/*
 * Allocation class interface
 *
 * When requesting an object from the allocator, the first step is to determine
 * which allocation class best approximates the size of the object.
 * Once found, the appropriate free list, called bucket, for that
 * class is selected in a fashion that minimizes contention between threads.
 * Depending on the requested size and the allocation class, it might happen
 * that the object size (including required metadata) would be bigger than the
 * allocation class size - called unit size. In those situations, the object is
 * constructed from two or more units (up to 64).
 *
 * If the requested number of units cannot be retrieved from the selected
 * bucket, the thread reaches out to the global, shared, heap which manages
 * memory in 256 kilobyte chunks and gives it out in a best-fit fashion. This
 * operation must be performed under an exclusive lock.
 * Once the thread is in the possession of a chunk, the lock is dropped, and the
 * memory is split into units that repopulate the bucket.
 *
 * These are the CTL entry points that control allocation classes:
 * - heap.alloc_class.[class_id].desc
 *	Creates/retrieves allocation class information
 *
 * It's VERY important to remember that the allocation classes are a RUNTIME
 * property of the allocator - they are NOT stored persistently in the pool.
 * It's recommended to always create custom allocation classes immediately after
 * creating or opening the pool, before any use.
 * If there are existing objects created using a class that is no longer stored
 * in the runtime state of the allocator, they can be normally freed, but
 * allocating equivalent objects will be done using the allocation class that
 * is currently defined for that size.
 *
 * Please see the libpmemobj man page for more information about entry points.
