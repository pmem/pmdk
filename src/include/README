Persistent Memory Development Kit

This is src/include/README.

This directory contains include files that are meant to be installed on
a system when the Persistent Memory Development Kit package is installed.
These include files provide the public information exported
by the libraries that is necessary for applications to call into
the libraries.  Private include files, used only internally in
the libraries, don't live here -- they typically live next to
the source for their module.

Here you'll find:

libpmem.h -- definitions of libpmem entry points (see libpmem(7))

libpmem2.h -- definitions of libpmem2 entry points (see libpmem2(7))

libpmemobj.h -- definitions of libpmemobj entry points (see libpmemobj(7))

libpmempool.h -- definitions of libpmempool entry points (see libpmempool(7))
