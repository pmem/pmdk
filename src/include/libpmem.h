 * libpmem.h -- definitions of libpmem entry points
 *
 * This library provides support for programming with Persistent Memory (PMEM).
 *
 * The libpmem entry points are divided below into these categories:
 *	- basic PMEM flush-to-durability support
 *	- support for memory allocation and transactions in PMEM
 *	- support for arrays of atomically-writable blocks
 *	- support for PMEM-resident log files
 *	- managing overall library behavior
 *
 * See libpmem(3) for details.
