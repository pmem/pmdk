 * - @ref manual transactions need to be committed manually, otherwise
 *	they will be aborted on object destruction.\n
 * - @ref automatic transactions are only available in C++17. They
 *	handle transaction commit/abort automatically.
 *
 * This class also exposes a closure-like transaction API, which is the
 * preferred way of handling transactions.
