/* Do a client request.  These are macros rather than a functions so

   NB: these duplicate definitions in hg_intercepts.c.  But here, we
   have to make do with weaker typing (no definition of Word etc) and
   no assertions, whereas in helgrind.h we can use those facilities.
   Obviously it's important the two sets of definitions are kept in
   sync.

   The commented-out asserts should actually hold, but unfortunately
   they can't be allowed to be visible here, because that would
   require the end-user code to #include <assert.h>.

/* End-user request for Ada applications compiled with GNAT.
   Helgrind understands the Ada concept of Ada task dependencies and
   terminations. See Ada Reference Manual section 9.3 "Task Dependence 
   - Termination of Tasks".
   However, in some cases, the master of (terminated) tasks completes
   only when the application exits. An example of this is dynamically
   allocated tasks with an access type defined at Library Level.
   By default, the state of such tasks in Helgrind will be 'exited but
   join not done yet'. Many tasks in such a state are however causing
   Helgrind CPU and memory to increase significantly.
   VALGRIND_HG_GNAT_DEPENDENT_MASTER_JOIN can be used to indicate
   to Helgrind that a not yet completed master has however already
   'seen' the termination of a dependent : this is conceptually the
   same as a pthread_join and causes the cleanup of the dependent
   as done by Helgrind when a master completes.
   This allows to avoid the overhead in helgrind caused by such tasks.
   A typical usage for a master to indicate it has done conceptually a join
   with a dependent task before the master completes is:
      while not Dep_Task'Terminated loop
         ... do whatever to wait for Dep_Task termination.
      end loop;
      VALGRIND_HG_GNAT_DEPENDENT_MASTER_JOIN
        (Dep_Task'Identity,
         Ada.Task_Identification.Current_Task);

/* A quite-broad set of annotations, as used in the ThreadSanitizer
   project.  This implementation aims to be a (source-level)
   compatible implementation of the macros defined in:

   http://code.google.com/p/data-race-test/source
          /browse/trunk/dynamic_annotations/dynamic_annotations.h

   (some of the comments below are taken from the above file)

   The implementation here is very incomplete, and intended as a
   starting point.  Many of the macros are unimplemented.  Rather than
   allowing unimplemented macros to silently do nothing, they cause an
   assertion.  Intention is to implement them on demand.

   The major use of these macros is to make visible to race detectors,
   the behaviour (effects) of user-implemented synchronisation
   primitives, that the detectors could not otherwise deduce from the
   normal observation of pthread etc calls.

   Some of the macros are no-ops in Helgrind.  That's because Helgrind
   is a pure happens-before detector, whereas ThreadSanitizer uses a
   hybrid lockset and happens-before scheme, which requires more
   accurate annotations for correct operation.

   The macros are listed in the same order as in dynamic_annotations.h
   (URL just above).

   I should point out that I am less than clear about the intended
   semantics of quite a number of them.  Comments and clarifications
   welcomed!

   If threads T1 .. Tn all do ANNOTATE_HAPPENS_BEFORE(obj) and later
   (w.r.t. some notional global clock for the computation) thread Tm
   does ANNOTATE_HAPPENS_AFTER(obj), then Helgrind will regard all
   memory accesses done by T1 .. Tn before the ..BEFORE.. call as
   happening-before all memory accesses done by Tm after the
   ..AFTER.. call.  Hence Helgrind won't complain about races if Tm's
   accesses afterwards are to the same locations as accesses before by
   any of T1 .. Tn.

   OBJ is a machine word (unsigned long, or void*), is completely
   arbitrary, and denotes the identity of some synchronisation object
   you're modelling.

   You must do the _BEFORE call just before the real sync event on the
   signaller's side, and _AFTER just after the real sync event on the
   waiter's side.

   If none of the rest of these macros make sense to you, at least
   take the time to understand these two.  They form the very essence
   of describing arbitrary inter-thread synchronisation events to
   Helgrind.  You can get a long way just with them alone.

   See also, extensive discussion on semantics of this in 
   https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=243935

   ANNOTATE_HAPPENS_BEFORE_FORGET_ALL(obj) is interim until such time
   as bug 243935 is fully resolved.  It instructs Helgrind to forget
   about any ANNOTATE_HAPPENS_BEFORE calls on the specified object, in
   effect putting it back in its original state.  Once in that state,
   a use of ANNOTATE_HAPPENS_AFTER on it has no effect on the calling
   thread.

   An implementation may optionally release resources it has
   associated with 'obj' when ANNOTATE_HAPPENS_BEFORE_FORGET_ALL(obj)
   happens.  Users are recommended to use
   ANNOTATE_HAPPENS_BEFORE_FORGET_ALL to indicate when a
   synchronisation object is no longer needed, so as to avoid
   potential indefinite resource leaks.
