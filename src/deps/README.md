Persistent Memory Development Kit

This is src/deps/README.

This directory contains a temporary copy of the miniasync repository.
Please do not modify the contents of this directory directly.
Instead, please contribute changes to the pmem/miniasync repository.
Use git sub-tree to pull changes for the pmem/miniasync repository.

This copy is intended to be removed when miniasync will be released,
and uploaded to the vcpkg repository.

> NOTICE:
Support for async functions is deprecated since PMDK 1.13.0 release
and will be removed in the PMDK 1.14.0 release along with the miniasync dependency.
