	* Version 0.1.0

	This is the first official release of the miniasync library.

	The library provides the API for asynchronous memory operations
	through the use of features and runtime mechanisms and independence
	in terms of hardware by implementing a virtual data mover.

	This release also contains:
	- documentation on the implemented functionality
	- basic examples
	- working build system based on GHA
	- functional test cases
