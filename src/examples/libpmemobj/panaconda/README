This is examples/libpmemobj/panconda/README.

This directory contains an example application implemented using libpmemobj,
it's a game in which all the objects are stored on persistent memory.
This means that the game process can be safely killed and then resumed.

To launch the game:
	./panaconda /path/game/session/file
	or
	./panaconda /path/game/session/file -m /path/config/file/conf/cfg

The second option allow you to define your own maze.
Meaning of symbols in config file is given below:
	'1' - wall
	'0' - space
conf.cfg contains example of predefined maze.

The file with the game session will either be created if it doesn't exist
or opened if it contains a valid pool.

Controls:
	move - arrow keys
	quit - 'q'
	new game - 'n'

This game demonstrates the usage of the very basics of the libpmemobj C++
bindings. It demonstrates pool management, persistent pointers and transactions.

** DEPENDENCIES: **
In order to build the game you need to install ncurses development package.

rpm-based systems : ncurses-devel
dpkg-based systems: libncursesX-dev (where X is the API/ABI version)
