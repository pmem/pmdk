Non-Volatile Memory Library

This is examples/libpmemobj/pman/README.

This directory contains an example application implemented using libpmemobj,
it's a game in which all the objects are stored on persistent memory.
This means that the game process can be safely killed and then resumed.

To launch the game:
	./pman <game session file> [map file]

The file with the game session will either be created if it doesn't exist
or opened if it contains a valid pool.

Controls:
	move - arrow keys, jkli
	place bomb - spacebar, b
	quit - 'q'
	resume - 'r'

This game demonstrates the usage of the very basics of the libpmemobj C++
bindings. It demonstrates pool management, persistent pointers and transactions.

** DEPENDENCIES: **
In order to build the game you need to install ncurses development package.

rpm-based systems : ncurses-devel
dpkg-based systems: libncursesX-dev (where X is the API/ABI version)
