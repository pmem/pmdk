pchess

This is examples/libpmemobj++/pchess/README.

A simple chess engine, using persistent memory to store the current state of
its thinking. It uses libpmemobj++ in many of its data structures, to present
how a non-trivial application can be easily created/transformed to use
persistent memory, without understanding all the intricate details hidden behind
the wrappers provided by the libpmemobj++ library.

To use, start with a path to a pmem pool file to use:
	./pchess /dev/shm/chess

Type help to get familiar with its usage.
