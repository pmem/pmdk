Non-Volatile Memory Library

This is examples/libpmemcto/life/README.

This directory contains an example application that implements
Conway's Game of Life using libpmemcto.

To launch the game:
	./life file [iterations]

The file with the game session will either be created if it doesn't exist
or opened if it contains a valid pool.

** DEPENDENCIES: **
In order to build both variants of the game you need to install ncurses
development package.

rpm-based systems : ncurses-devel
dpkg-based systems: libncursesX-dev (where X is the API/ABI version)
