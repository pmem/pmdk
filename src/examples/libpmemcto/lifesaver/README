Persistent Memory Development Kit

This is examples/libpmemcto/lifesaver/README.

This directory contains an example a simple screen saver for Windows,
which implements Conway's Game of Life.

To launch the screen saver:
	.\lifesaver.scr

To install the screen saver, copy the .scr file into your system folder
(i.e. C:\Windows\System32), then right-click on the Windows Desktop and
select "Personalize" and "Screen Saver". Now, in the dialog box you can select
"LifeSaver" from the list. Click "Settings..." to configure the location of
the game session file (default is C:\temp\life.cto").

The file with the game session will either be created if it doesn't exist
or opened if it contains a valid pool.
