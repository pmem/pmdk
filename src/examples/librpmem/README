This is src/example/librpmem/README file.

This directory contains a basic example application utilizing
a librpmem library:

usage: ./basic [create|remove|open] <target> <pool set>

This example creates, removes or opens a specified pool set file on
a target node.

After opening a remote pool, pool attributes are compared with default
values which were used to create a pool set.

This example works with the rpmemd daemon, which must serve a specified
pool set file, for example:
PMEMPOOLSET
64M /path/to/file1.dat
64M /path/to/file2.dat

The daemon must be invoked in the same directory where the pool set file
is stored or must take an argument which points to the directory which
contains the pool set file:

$ ls
pool.set
$ ./rpmemd

or

ls /my/dir
pool.set
$ ./rpmemd -d /my/dir
