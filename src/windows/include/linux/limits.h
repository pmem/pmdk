 * linux/limits.h -- fake header file

/*
 * XXX - The only purpose of this empty file is to avoid preprocessor
 * errors when including a Linux-specific header file that has no equivalent
 * on Windows.  With this cheap trick, we don't need a lot of preprocessor
 * conditionals in all the source code files.
 *
 * In the future, this will be addressed in some other way.
