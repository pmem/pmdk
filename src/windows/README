Non-Volatile Memory Library

This is src/windows/README.

This directory contains the Windows-specific source for the NVM Library.

The subdirectory "include" contains header files that have no equivalents
on Windows OS, when building NVML using VC++ compiler.
Some of those files are empty, which is a cheap trick to avoid preprocessor
errors when including non-existing files.  This way we don't need a lot
of preprocessor conditionals in all the source code files.

The "platform.h" file contains definitions of all the basic types and macros
that are not available under VC++.  When building NVML with Visual Studio,
"platform.h" file is included to each source file using "/FI" (forced include)
option.

The subdirectory "getopt" contains a windows implementation of getopt and
getopt_long
