 *
 *
 * PERSISTENT MEMORY INSTRUCTIONS ON X86
 *
 * The primary feature of this library is to provide a way to flush
 * changes to persistent memory as outlined below (note that many
 * of the decisions below are made at initialization time, and not
 * repeated every time a flush is requested).
 *
 * To flush a range to pmem when CLWB is available:
 *
 *	CLWB for each cache line in the given range.
 *
 *	SFENCE to ensure the CLWBs above have completed.
 *
 *	PCOMMIT to mark pmem stores in the memory subsystem.
 *
 *	SFENCE to ensure the stores marked by PCOMMIT above have completed.
 *
 * To flush a range to pmem when CLFLUSHOPT is available and CLWB is not
 * (same as above but issue CLFLUSHOPT instead of CLWB):
 *
 *	CLFLUSHOPT for each cache line in the given range.
 *
 *	SFENCE to ensure the CLWBs above have completed.
 *
 *	PCOMMIT to mark pmem stores in the memory subsystem.
 *
 *	SFENCE to ensure the stores marked by PCOMMIT above have completed.
 *
 * To flush a range to pmem when neither CLFLUSHOPT or CLWB are available
 * (same as above but fences surrounding CLFLUSH are not required):
 *
 *	CLFLUSH for each cache line in the given range.
 *
 *	PCOMMIT to mark pmem stores in the memory subsystem.
 *
 *	SFENCE to ensure the stores marked by PCOMMIT above have completed.
 *
 * To flush a range to pmem when the caller has explicitly assumed
 * responsibility for draining HW stores in the memory subsystem
 * (by choosing to depend on ADR, or by assuming responsibility to issue
 * PCOMMIT/SFENCE at some point):
 *
 * 	Same as above flows but omit the final PCOMMIT and SFENCE.
 *
 * To memcpy a range of memory to pmem when MOVNT is available:
 *
 *	Copy any non-64-byte portion of the destination using MOV.
 *
 *	Use the non-PCOMMIT flush flow above for the copied portion.
 *
 *	Copy using MOVNTDQ, up to any non-64-byte aligned end portion.
 *	(The MOVNT instructions bypass the cache, so no flush is required.)
 *
 *	Copy any unaligned end portion using MOV.
 *
 *	Use the flush flow above for the copied portion (including PCOMMIT).
 *
 * To memcpy a range of memory to pmem when MOVNT is not available:
 *
 *	Just pass the call to the normal memcpy() followed by pmem_persist().
 *
 * To memset a non-trivial sized range of memory to pmem:
 *
 *	Same as the memcpy cases above but store the given value instead
 *	of reading values from the source.
 *
 *
 * INTERFACES FOR FLUSHING TO PERSISTENT MEMORY
 *
 * Given the flows above, three interfaces are provided for flushing a range
 * so that the caller has the ability to separate the steps when necessary,
 * but otherwise leaves the detection of available instructions to the libpmem:
 *
 * pmem_persist(addr, len)
 *
 *	This is the common case, which just calls the two other functions:
 *
 *		pmem_flush(addr, len);
 *		pmem_drain();
 *
 * pmem_flush(addr, len)
 *
 *	CLWB or CLFLUSHOPT or CLFLUSH for each cache line
 *
 * pmem_drain()
 *
 *	SFENCE unless using CLFLUSH
 *
 *	PCOMMIT
 *
 *	SFENCE
 *
 * When PCOMMIT is unavailable, either because the platform doesn't support it
 * or because it has been inhibited by the caller by setting PMEM_NO_PCOMMIT=1,
 * the pmem_drain() function degenerates into this:
 *
 * pmem_drain()
 *
 *	SFENCE unless using CLFLUSH
 *
 *
 * INTERFACES FOR COPYING/SETTING RANGES OF MEMORY
 *
 * Given the flows above, the following interfaces are provided for the
 * memmove/memcpy/memset operations to persistent memory:
 *
 * pmem_memmove_nodrain()
 *
 * 	Checks for overlapped ranges to determine whether to copy from
 * 	the beginning of the range or the from the end.  If MOVNT instructions
 * 	are available, uses the memory copy flow described above, otherwise
 * 	calls the libc memmove() followed by pmem_flush().
 *
 * pmem_memcpy_nodrain()
 *
 * 	Just calls pmem_memmove_nodrain().
 *
 * pmem_memset_nodrain()
 *
 * 	If MOVNT instructions are available, uses the memset flow described
 * 	above, otherwise calls the libc memset() followed by pmem_flush().
 *
 * pmem_memmove()
 * pmem_memcpy()
 * pmem_memset()
 *
 * 	Calls the appropriate _nodrain() function followed by pmem_drain().
 *
 *
 * DECISIONS MADE AT INITIALIZATION TIME
 *
 * As much as possible, all decisions described above are made at library
 * initialization time.  This is achieved using function pointers that are
 * setup by pmem_init() when the library loads.
 *
 * 	Func_predrain_fence is used by pmem_drain() to call one of:
 * 		predrain_fence_empty()
 * 		predrain_fence_sfence()
 *
 *	Func_drain is used by pmem_drain() to call one of:
 *		drain_no_pcommit()
 *		drain_pcommit()
 *
 *	Func_flush is used by pmem_flush() to call one of:
 *		flush_clwb()
 *		flush_clflushopt()
 *		flush_clflush()
 *
 *	Func_memmove_nodrain is used by memmove_nodrain() to call one of:
 *		memmove_nodrain_normal()
 *		memmove_nodrain_movnt()
 *
 *	Func_memset_nodrain is used by memset_nodrain() to call one of:
 *		memset_nodrain_normal()
 *		memset_nodrain_movnt()
