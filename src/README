Persistent Memory Development Kit

This is src/README.

This directory contains the source for the Persistent Memory Development Kit.

The subdirectory "include" contains header files that get delivered
along with the libraries.  Everything else is internal to the libraries
and lives in this directory.

Two versions of the libraries are built, a debug version and a nondebug
version.  The object files and the libraries themselves end up in the
subdirectories "debug" and "nondebug".

See the top-level README for build, test, and installation instructions.
The basic "make" and "make test" targets also work from this directory.
