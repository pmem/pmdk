This is src/test/tools/obj_verify/README.

This directory contains a simple tool 'obj_verify' for verifying pmemobj pools.

'obj_verify' has two modes of operation:
  1) 'c' - create a pmemobj pool
  2) 'v' - verify a pmemobj pool

The 'create' operation creates or opens a pmemobj pool and fills it up
with records consisting of the following fields:
1) signature ("OBJ_VERIFY")
2) sequence number saved as string
3) buffer filled with random integers
4) checksum of all the above fields

The 'verify' operation verifies that checksums of all saved records are correct.
