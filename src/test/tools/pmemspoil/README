Persistent Memory Development Kit

This is src/test/tools/pmemspoil/README.

This directory contains a simple application for corrupting pool files.

This application may be used for testing purposes. It allows one to modify
every single field in all structures used by Persistent Memory Development Kit.

Usage:
	$ pmemspoil <file> <field>=<value>...

<file>		- pool file
<field>		- name of field in structure to modify
<value>		- new value, for numerical fields you can use either decimal or
		  hexadecimal format with 0x prefix.

You can specify more than one field to modify at single call.

The format of <field> may contain multiple levels of structure fields and may
contain index of specified structure if there is more than one in a pool file.

The pmemspoil supports the following structures:
	- pool_hdr		- see util.h for details
	- pmemlog		- see log.h for details
	- arena			- specify arena index

Examples:

In order to change pool_hdr's signature and start offset of pmemlog pool:
	$ pmemspoil /path/to/file pool_hdr.signature=ERROR\
				pmemlog.start_offset=0x0
