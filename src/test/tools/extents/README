This is src/test/tools/extents/README.

This directory contains a tool for listing physical extents of a file.

Usage:
	$ extents file [logical-block-number]

If no 'logical-block-number' is given, than the output of this command
is a simple list of pairs: offset and length expressed in sectors
(offset from the beginning of the device).

If a 'logical-block-number' is given, than the output of this command
is the physical block number of a given logical one.
