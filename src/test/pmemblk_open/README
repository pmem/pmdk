This is src/test/pmemblk_open/README.

This directory contains a unit test for pmemblk_open().

The program in pmemblk_open.c takes a file name and two block size
arguments.  If the file name is set to "NULLFILE", the program
will create its own 64 MB pool.  This serves to test two code paths
in pmemblk_create, the path where an external file is supplied, and
the path where one is not.  The two block size arguments are passed
to the pmemblk_create() and pmemblk_open() routines.  This allows
the code path that is taken when the two block sizes are different
to be tested.
