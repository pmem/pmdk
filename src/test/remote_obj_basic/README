This is src/test/remote_obj_basic/README.

This directory contains a unit test for remote tests support.

The program in remote_obj_basic.c takes a mode (create or open) and a name
of a poolset file as arguments and creates or opens a PMEMOBJ pool set
with the given name.

The TEST0 unit test copies a pool set file from the local host
to the remote node, removes all pool set part files using pmempool
and creates the pool set using the run_on_node() function.

The TEST1 unit test does exactly what TEST0 does and additionally
it opens the created pool set using the run_on_node() function.

The TEST2 unit test does what TEST0 does but it creates the pool set using
the run_on_node_background() and wait_on_node() functions.

The TEST3 unit test does exactly what TEST2 does and additionally
it opens the created pool set using the run_on_node_background()
and wait_on_node() functions.
