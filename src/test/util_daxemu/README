Non-Volatile Memory Library

This is src/test/util_daxemu/README.

This directory contains unit tests for memory mapping and file I/O
routines on Device DAX.  It is mostly intended to verify in libdaxemu
provides exactly the same behavior as the real Device DAX.

The program in util_daxemu.c takes a list of paths to Device DAX
devices.  For example:

	./util_daxemu /dev/dax0.0 /dev/dax1.0
