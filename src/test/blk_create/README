This is src/test/blk_create/README.

This directory contains a unit test for pmemblk_create().

The program in blk_create.c takes: path, bsize, poolsize, mode

For example:

	./blk_create /my/file 4096 20 0640

This calls pmemblk_create() with the given arguments.  Note that poolsize
is given in megabytes.

Test cases:

- expected to be successful
	TEST0 non-existing file, poolsize > 0
	TEST1 existing file, file length >= min required size, poolsize == 0
	TEST8 existing file, file length >= min required size, poolsize == 0
	(file contains garbage, except for header)

- expected to fail
	TEST2 non-existing file, poolsize == 0
	TEST3 existing file, file length >= min required size, poolsize > 0
	TEST4 existing file, file length < min required size, poolsize == 0
	TEST[56] two success cases above, but path is invalid (directory not exist)
	TEST7 existing file, file length >= min required size, poolsize == 0
	(file contains garbage)

- each case outputs:
	- error, if error happened
	- resulting file size, nblocks, mode, consistency check results
