#


# GLOBAL REQUIREMENTS

# Global requirements are applied for all TEST<num> scripts in the sub-directory
# where config.sh file is located.

# Most tests are short "make check" tests, designed to run quickly when
# smoke-checking a build.  Two other test types are available: short and long.
# A test script can indicate it should only run during a long test run, for
# example, using:
	CONF_GLOBAL_TEST_TYPE=long

# If a test does not need any storage, the script uses this line:
	CONF_GLOBAL_FS_TYPE=none
# Similarly, if the test only makes sense for pmem or non-pmem:
	CONF_GLOBAL_FS_TYPE=pmem
# or
	CONF_GLOBAL_FS_TYPE=non-pmem
# If a test needs storage but does not care about its type:
	CONF_GLOBAL_FS_TYPE=any

# Similar to the above, tests can require a specific build types:
	CONF_GLOBAL_BUILD_TYPE=debug

# Test can also require custom timeout:
	CONF_GLOBAL_TIMEOUT=5m

# Remote tests must explicitly require use of fabric providers and persistency
# methods:
	CONF_GLOBAL_RPMEM_PROVIDER=all
	CONF_GLOBAL_RPMEM_PMETHOD=all

# If remote test requires Valgrind support it must explicitly set this
# requirement:
	CONF_GLOBAL_RPMEM_VALGRIND=y


# PER TEST<num> REQUIREMENTS

# Per TEST<num> requirements are applied only for single TEST<num> script.

# If TEST<num> require other test type than provided by CONF_GLOBAL_TEST_TYPE
# variable it can indicate this requirement using:
#	CONF_TEST_TYPE[<num>]=short

# The same for any other global requirements:
#	CONF_FS_TYPE[<num>]=any
#	CONF_BUILD_TYPE[<num>]="debug nondebug"
#	CONF_RPMEM_PROVIDER[<num>]=verbs
#	CONF_RPMEM_PMETHOD[<num>]=GPSPM
#	CONF_RPMEM_VALGRIND[<num>]=y
