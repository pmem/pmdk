This is src/test/pmem_memcpy/README.

This directory contains a unit test for pmem_memcpy().

The program in pmem_memcpy.c requires 4 arguments to be specified:
	file name
	dest off
	src off
	num bytes

A zero for the dest offset and src offset are valid.

This test performs tests for dest > src, and src > dest.
