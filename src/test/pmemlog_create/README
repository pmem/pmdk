This is src/test/pmemlog_create/README.

This directory contains a unit test for pmemlog_create().

The program in pmemlog_create.c takes a file name and a block size
as arguments.  If the file name is set to "NULLFILE", the program
will create its own 64 MB pool.  This serves to test two code paths
in pmemlog_create, the path where an external file is supplied, and
the path where one is not.
