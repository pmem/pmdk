 * mocks_windows.h -- redefinitions of pthread functions

 * This file is Windows-specific.
 *
 * This file should be included (i.e. using Forced Include) by libpmemobj
 * files, when compiled for the purpose of obj_sync test.
 * It would replace default implementation with mocked functions defined
 * in obj_sync.c.
 *
 * These defines could be also passed as preprocessor definitions.
