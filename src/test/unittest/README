Persistent Memory Development Kit

This is src/test/unittest/README.

This directory contains the unit test framework used by
the Persistent Memory Development Kit unit tests.

This framework provides a support for mock objects. To mock an interface use
FUNC_MOCK_RET_ALWAYS, FUNC_MOCK_RET_ALWAYS_VOID, FUNC_MOCK or
FUNC_MOCK_NONSTATIC macros in the test code.

The FUNC_MOCK_RET_ALWAYS is quite straightforward, it simply takes a function
name and a value that the given function has to return. For example:

    FUNC_MOCK_RET_ALWAYS(malloc, NULL)

This declaration causes all malloc calls to return NULL and thus facilitates
error path tests.

The rest of FUNC_MOCK set of macros is used in more complicated cases.
It allows to implement replacement logic for different runs of the given
function. For example:

    FUNC_MOCK(malloc, void *, size_t size)
	FUNC_MOCK_RUN_RET_DEFAULT_REAL(malloc, size)
	FUNC_MOCK_RUN(2) {
	    UT_ASSERTeq(size, 8);
	    return NULL;
	}
    FUNC_MOCK_END

This declaration causes the third malloc call to return NULL and also verifies
if the size argument is of expected size. All other mallocs fallback to the
real implementation.
Those macros can be used on all non-static functions that are in a different
compilation unit than the test itself.

Because the mocking framework uses the linker to wrap the functions, all tests
have to add appropriate linker flags. For convenience, there is a makefile
function 'extract_funcs' which parses the source file looking for the
FUNC_MOCK_RET_ALWAYS or FUNC_MOCK and adds the wrap flag for all the encountered
functions. Test makefile that wishes to use this functionality should
contain following line:

    LDFLAGS += $(call extract_funcs, [test_name].c)

And after that no changes in makefile is required at all when adding new
mocks.
