This is src/test/rpmemd_db_test/README.

This directory contains a very basic unit test for pool set database.

The program in rpmemd_db_test.c takes a root directory of pool sets,
a pool descriptor and a log file as arguments and performs basic tests for
the following functions:
	- rpmemd_db_init
	- rpmemd_db_fini
	- rpmemd_db_check_dir
	- rpmemd_db_pool_create
	- rpmemd_db_pool_open
	- rpmemd_db_pool_close
	- rpmemd_db_pool_remove
