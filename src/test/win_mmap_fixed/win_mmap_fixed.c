 * win_mmap_fixed.c -- test memory mapping with MAP_FIXED for various lengths
 *
 * This test is intended to be used for testing Windows implementation
 * of memory mapping routines - mmap(), munmap(), msync() and mprotect().
 * Those functions should provide the same functionality as their Linux
 * counterparts, at least with respect to the features that are used
 * in NVM libraries.
 *
 * Known issues and differences between Linux and Windows implementation
 * are described in src/common/mmap_windows.c.
