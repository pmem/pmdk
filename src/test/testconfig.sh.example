#
# src/test/testconfig.sh -- configuration for local and remote unit tests
#

#
# 1) *** LOCAL CONFIGURATION ***
#
# The first part of the file tells the script unittest/unittest.sh
# which file system locations are to be used for local testing.
#

#
# For tests that require true persistent memory, set the path to a directory
# on a PMEM-aware file system here.  Comment this line out if there's no
# actual persistent memory available on this system.
#
#PMEM_FS_DIR=/mnt/pmem

#
# For tests that require true a non-persistent memory aware file system (i.e.
# to verify something works on traditional page-cache based memory-mapped
# files) set the path to a directory on a normal file system here.
#
NON_PMEM_FS_DIR=/tmp

#
# If you don't have real PMEM or PMEM emulation set up, but still want to test
# PMEM codepaths uncomment this line. It will set PMEM_IS_PMEM_FORCE to 1 for
# tests that require pmem.
#
#PMEM_FS_DIR_FORCE_PMEM=1

#
# For tests that require raw dax devices without a file system, set a path to
# those devices in an array format. For most tests one device is enough, but
# some might require more.
#
#DEVICE_DAX_PATH=(/dev/dax0.0)

#
# 2) *** REMOTE CONFIGURATION ***
#
# The second part of the file tells the script unittest/unittest.sh
# which remote nodes and their file system locations are to be used
# for remote testing.
#

#
# Addresses of nodes should be defined as an array:
#
#    NODE[index]=[<user>@]<host-name-or-IP>
#
#NODE[0]=127.0.0.1
#NODE[1]=user1@host1
#NODE[2]=user2@host2

#
# Addresses of interfaces which the remote nodes
# shall communicate on should be defined as an array:
#
#    NODE_ADDR[index]=[<user>@]<host-name-or-IP>
#
#NODE_ADDR[0]=192.168.0.1
#NODE_ADDR[1]=192.168.0.2
#NODE_ADDR[2]=192.168.0.3

#
# Working directories on remote nodes (they will be created)
#
#NODE_WORKING_DIR[0]=/remote/dir0
#NODE_WORKING_DIR[1]=/remote/dir1
#NODE_WORKING_DIR[2]=/remote/dir2

#
# NODE_LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable for each remote node
#
#NODE_LD_LIBRARY_PATH[0]=/usr/local/lib
#NODE_LD_LIBRARY_PATH[1]=/usr/local/lib
#NODE_LD_LIBRARY_PATH[2]=/usr/local/lib
#

#
# NODE_ENV variable for setting environment variables on specified nodes
#
#NODE_ENV[0]="VAR=1"
#NODE_ENV[1]="VAR=\$VAR:1"
#NODE_ENV[2]=""
