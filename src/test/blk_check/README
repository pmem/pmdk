This is src/test/blk_check/README.

This directory contains a unit test for pmemblk_check.

The program in blk_check.c takes a file name and a list test ids
as argument. For example:

	./blk_check file1

this will perform a pemmblk_check on the file named file1 and
inject hard-wired error conditions.
