This directory contains a unit test for POBJ_NEXT and POBJ_FIRST macros.

Syntax:
$ obj_first_next <fname> <operation>..

Operations:
 - P:<type_num>        - print all objects from <list> in normal order
 - a:<type_num>:<id>   - allocate a new object with type number equal to <type_num>
                         and set <id> to id using constructor
 - r:<type_num>:<num>  - remove <num> object on internal list of objects with type
                         number equal to <type_num>
 - n:<type_num>:<num>  - return id of <num> + 1 object on internal list of objects
                         with type_number equal to <type_num>
 - f:<type_num>        - return id of first object on internal list of objects with
                         type_number equal to <type_num>

<list>:
- 0 - objects with type number equal to 0
- 1 - objects with type number equal to 1
