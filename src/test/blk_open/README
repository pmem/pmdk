This is src/test/blk_open/README.

This directory contains a unit test for pmemblk_open().

The program in blk_open.c takes: path, bsize

For example:

	./blk_open /my/file 4096

This calls pmemblk_open() with the given arguments.

Test cases:

- expected to be successful
	TEST0 existing file
	TEST1 non-existing file, the file will be created with the given bsize

- expected to fail
	TEST2 existing file, but it has read-only permissions
	TEST3 non-existing file, but bsize does not match

- each case outputs:
	- error, if error happened
	- resulting file size, nblocks, mode, consistency check results
