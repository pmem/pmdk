This is src/test/pmem_map/README.

This directory contains a unit test for pmem_map().

The program in pmem_map.c takes a file name as an argument.

Initially, the first 4k of the file is populated with some pattern
using write(). The file content is verified after successful mapping
with pmem_map(). Then, the program overwrites the first 4k of the
mapped memory region with another pattern, unmaps the file, and
verifies its content once again.

Finally, the program re-opens the file with read-only access then
tries to map the file and prints an error message if pmem_map()
does not fail (it should fail when the file is opened with
read-only access).
