This is src/test/util_poolset_size/README.

This directory contains a unit test for util_poolset_size().

The program in util_poolset_size.c takes a file name(s) as arguments:

For example:
	./util_poolset_size pool.set1 pool.set2

This will call util_poolset_size() on all files and print result value.
