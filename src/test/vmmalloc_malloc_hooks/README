Persistent Memory Development Kit

This is src/test/vmmalloc_malloc_hooks/README.

This directory contains a unit test for libvmmalloc malloc hooks.

The program in vmmalloc_malloc_hooks.c modifies the behavior of the system
memory allocation routines by specifying its custom hook functions.

The libvmmalloc library is expected to override malloc hooks, so when the test
program is run with libvmmalloc.so.1 pre-loaded, the user-defined hooks should
never be called.
