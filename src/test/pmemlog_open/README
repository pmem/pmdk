This is src/test/pmemlog_open/README.

This directory contains a unit test for pmemlog_open().

The program in pmemlog_open.c takes a file name as an argument.
If the file name is set to "NULLFILE", the program will create
its own 64 MB pool.  This serves to test two code paths in
pmemblk_create, the path where an external file is supplied, and
the path where one is not.
