# src/test/log_basic/TEST9 -- unit test for:
# - pmemlog_append
# and:
# - pmemlog_nbyte
# - pmemlog_tell
# - pmemlog_walk
# - pmemlog_rewind
# in case of non-empty pool and
# - pmemlog_check
# - pmemlog_open
# - pmemlog_close
#
# Same as TEST1, but run on a pool set that spans two Device DAX devices
# with 2M alignment. Expected failure, as 2M alignment is not supported
# if NOHDRS option is not specified.
