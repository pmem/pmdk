Non-Volatile Memory Library

This is src/test/remote_basic/README.

This directory contains a very basic unit test for remote tests support.

The program in remote_basic.c takes a file name as an argument
and checks if the given file exists. Next it prints two exemplary messages:
the first one is printed to stdout and the second one to stderr.

The unit tests copy a test file from the local host to the remote node
and check if it exists using:
	- run_on_node() function in case of TEST0
	- run_on_node_background() and wait_on_node() in case of TEST1
