This is src/test/pmem_memmove/README.

This directory contains a unit test for pmem_memmove().

The program in pmem_memmove.c takes a file name and a block size as
required arguments. The optional arguments are:
	d: destintation offset
	s: source offset
	o: overlap, 1 == src overlap, 2 == dest overlap
	S: with o, overlap amount(in bytes)

In all cases it sets a pattern of Z's and T's of 1/2 the block size specified. It
then tests for success by doing a memcmp and reading the file directly.
