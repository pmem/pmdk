Persistent Memory Development Kit

This is src/test/obj_persist_count/README.

This directory contains a unit test that verifies the number of internal
calls to pmem_flush, pmem_drain and pmem_persist (PMEM FS), or to pmem_msync
(non-PMEM FS) for basic pmemobj operations.

Any change to the number of PMEM flushes/drains may indicate potential
regression introduced as a side effect of other changes in libpmemobj.

Usage:
$ obj_persist_count <file>
