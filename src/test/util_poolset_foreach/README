This is src/test/util_poolset_foreach/README.

This directory contains a unit test for util_poolset_foreach_part().

The program in util_poolset_foreach.c takes a file name(s) as arguments:

For example:
	./util_poolset_foreach pool.set1 pool.set2

This will call util_poolset_foreach_part() on all files, print result value
and will print all part files from given poolset.
