This is src/test/pmem_memset/README.

This directory contains a unit test for pmem_memset().

The program in pmem_memset.c takes a file name as an argument. It
tests two cases, aligned dest addr and unaligned dest addr.

Initially the program maps the file to be used as the dest addr for the test.
It fills in the buffer used for setting the destination file with Z's and T's.

The file is read after processing the memset to ensure contains the correct values.
