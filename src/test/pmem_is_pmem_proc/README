Persistent Memory Development Kit

This is src/test/pmem_is_pmem_proc/README.

This directory contains a unit test for pmem_is_pmem().

The program in pmem_is_pmem_proc.c takes a list of fake memory regions
(an address and a length) and modifies the internal file map tracking list by adding
or removing given region, depending on the op argument ('a' - add, 'r' - remove).
It arranges for pmem_is_pmem() to use this fake list of file mappings when
looking up the range.

	usage: pmem_is_pmem_proc op addr len [op addr len]...

op is one of: 'a' (add), 'r' (remove), 't' (test)
addr is interpreted as a hex value, len as a decimal value unless it
starts with 0x.  If op argument is 't', then addr/len pair is tested against
the current list of memory regions.
