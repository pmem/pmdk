 * palloc_operation -- persistent memory operation. Takes a NULL pointer

 *
 * The malloc, free and realloc routines are implemented in the context of this
 * common operation which encompasses all of the functionality usually done
 * separately in those methods.
 *
 * The first thing that needs to be done is determining which memory blocks
 * will be affected by the operation - this varies depending on the whether the
 * operation will need to modify or free an existing block and/or allocate
 * a new one.
 *
 * Simplified allocation process flow is as follows:
 *	- reserve a new block in the transient heap
 *	- prepare the new block
 *	- create redo log of required modifications
 *		- chunk metadata
 *		- offset of the new object
 *	- commit and process the redo log
 *
 * And similarly, the deallocation process:
 *	- create redo log of required modifications
 *		- reverse the chunk metadata back to the 'free' state
 *		- set the destination of the object offset to zero
 *	- commit and process the redo log
 * There's an important distinction in the deallocation process - it does not
 * return the memory block to the transient container. That is done once no more
 * memory is available.
 *
 * Reallocation is a combination of the above, which one additional step
 * of copying the old content in the meantime.
