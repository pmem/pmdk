	/*
	 * Huge memory blocks are directly backed by memory chunks. A single
	 * huge block can consist of several chunks.
	 * The persistent representation of huge memory blocks can be thought
	 * of as a doubly linked list with variable length elements.
	 * That list is stored in the chunk headers array where one element
	 * directly corresponds to one chunk.
	 *
	 * U - used, F - free, R - footer, . - empty
	 * |U| represents a used chunk with a size index of 1, with type
	 * information (CHUNK_TYPE_USED) stored in the corresponding header
	 * array element - chunk_headers[chunk_id].
	 *
	 * |F...R| represents a free chunk with size index of 5. The empty
	 * chunk headers have undefined values and shouldn't be used. All
	 * chunks with size larger than 1 must have a footer in the last
	 * corresponding header array - chunk_headers[chunk_id - size_idx - 1].
	 *
	 * The above representation of chunks will be used to describe the
	 * way fail-safety is achieved during heap operations.
	 *
	 * Allocation of huge memory block with size index 5:
	 * Initial heap state: |U| <> |F..R| <> |U| <> |F......R|
	 *
	 * The only block that matches that size is at very end of the chunks
	 * list: |F......R|
	 *
	 * As the request was for memory block of size 5, and this ones size is
	 * 7 there's a need to first split the chunk in two.
	 * 1) The last chunk header of the new allocation is marked as footer
	 *	and the block after that one is marked as free: |F...RF.R|
	 *	This is allowed and has no impact on the heap because this
	 *	modification is into chunk header that is otherwise unused, in
	 *	other words the linked list didn't change.
	 *
	 * 2) The size index of the first header is changed from previous value
	 *	of 7 to 5: |F...R||F.R|
	 *	This is a single fail-safe atomic operation and this is the
	 *	first change that is noticeable by the heap operations.
	 *	A single linked list element is split into two new ones.
	 *
	 * 3) The allocation process either uses redo log or changes directly
	 *	the chunk header type from free to used: |U...R| <> |F.R|
	 *
	 * In a similar fashion the reverse operation, free, is performed:
	 * Initial heap state: |U| <> |F..R| <> |F| <> |U...R| <> |F.R|
	 *
	 * This is the heap after the previous example with the single chunk
	 * in between changed from used to free.
	 *
	 * 1) Determine the neighbors of the memory block which is being
	 *	freed.
	 *
	 * 2) Update the footer (if needed) information of the last chunk which
	 *	is the memory block being freed or it's neighbor to the right.
	 *	|F| <> |U...R| <> |F.R << this one|
	 *
	 * 3) Update the size index and type of the left-most chunk header.
	 *	And so this: |F << this one| <> |U...R| <> |F.R|
	 *	becomes this: |F.......R|
	 *	The entire chunk header can be updated in a single fail-safe
	 *	atomic operation because it's size is only 64 bytes.

	/*
	 * Run memory blocks are chunks with CHUNK_TYPE_RUN and size index of 1.
	 * The entire chunk is subdivided into smaller blocks and has an
	 * additional metadata attached in the form of a bitmap - each bit
	 * corresponds to a single block.
	 * In this case there's no need to perform any coalescing or splitting
	 * on the persistent metadata.
	 * The bitmap is stored on a variable number of 64 bit values and
	 * because of the requirement of allocation fail-safe atomicity the
	 * maximum size index of a memory block from a run is 64 - since that's
	 * the limit of atomic write guarantee.
	 *
	 * The allocation/deallocation process is a single 8 byte write that
	 * sets/clears the corresponding bits. Depending on the user choice
	 * it can either be made atomically or using redo-log when grouped with
	 * other operations.
	 * It's also important to note that in a case of realloc it might so
	 * happen that a single 8 byte bitmap value has its bits both set and
	 * cleared - that's why the run memory block metadata changes operate
	 * on AND'ing or OR'ing a bitmask instead of directly setting the value.
