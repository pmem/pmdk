/*
 * memblock.c -- implementation of memory block
 *
 * Memory block is a representation of persistent object that resides in the
 * heap. A valid memory block must be either a huge (free or used) chunk or a
 * block inside a run.
 *
 * Huge blocks are 1:1 correlated with the chunk headers in the zone whereas
 * run blocks are represented by bits in corresponding chunk bitmap.
 *
 * This file contains implementations of abstract operations on memory blocks.
 * Instead of storing the mbops structure inside each memory block the correct
 * method implementation is chosen at runtime.
