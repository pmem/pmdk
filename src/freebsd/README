Non-Volatile Memory Library

This is src/freebsd/README.

This directory contains FreeBSD-specific files for the NVM Library.

The subdirectory "include" contains header files that have no equivalents
on FreeBSD. Most of these files are empty, which is a cheap trick to avoid
preprocessor errors when including non-existing files. Others are redirects
for files that are in different locations on FreeBSD. This way we don't
need a lot of preprocessor conditionals in all the source code files, although
it does require conditionals in the Makefiles (which could be addressed by
using autoconf).
