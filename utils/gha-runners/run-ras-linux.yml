# Ansible playbook which is executing PMDK RAS test: Unsafe Shutdown Local on Linux.

# Requirements:
# 1. Two bare metal platforms with pmem memory installed. First machine is a controller, the second one is a runner.
# 2. The runner platform requires a specific HW setup: at least 4 functional DIMMs have to be present in the system.
#    This is due to the tests using multiple regions with namespaces to store data,
#    whose health is later compared and verified after an error injection and an unsafe shutdown of the system.
# 3. ErrorInjectionEnabled option must be enabled in the systems BIOS (the runner only).
# 4. Ssh keys exchanged between machines (optional but highly recommended).
# 5. List of required packages:
#   - ansible ( minimum 2.10 ) - controller platform only.
#   - ipmitool
#   - ipmctl
#   - ndctl
#   - make
#   - cmake
#   - lxml

# To launch the playbook, use ansible specific command on the controller machine:
# ansible-playbook -i /path/to/inventory /path/to/playbook.yml -e "host=some_host_or_group ansible_user=some_user"
# Where:
# - -i inventory - file which defines the hosts and groups of hosts upon which commands, modules, and tasks in a playbook operate.
#   If no inventory file is present, the user may simply use an IP address of the host; ansible-playbook -i <IP address>
# - run-ras-linux.yml - name of this script.
#   Adding path to the script file is optional if the playbook is launched from the same directory.
# - '-e' or --extra-vars - is a section where the user may add several variables used by ansible or override the existing ones on the host platform.
# - host - Name of the runner platform as specified in an inventory file or an IP address.
# - ansible_user - specify which user ansible will use to connect to the runner and run tasks.

# Warning! If the user won't exchange ssh keys between platforms, an additional variable will be needed to successfully
# run the playbook: 'ansible_password' with the password of the ansible_user.

# Examples:
# 1. ansible-playbook -i /home/test_user/hosts.yml run-ras-linux.yml -e "host=all ansible_user=test-user"
# 2. ansible-playbook -i 192.168.0.1, /home/test_user/run-ras-linux.yml -e "host=192.168.0.1 ansible_user=test-user"

# Note, that the comma is needed only if no inventory file is used, as shown in the example no.2

# More information about ansible playbook command and its options can be found here:
# https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/cli/ansible-playbook.html#ansible-playbook

# More information about tests can be found here:
# https://github.com/pmem/pmdk-tests/blob/master/README.md

# More information about the config file can be found here:
# https://github.com/pmem/pmdk-tests/blob/master/etc/config/README.md

# The general workflow of the test is as follows:
#  1. Create `AppDirectNotInterleaved` region.
#  2. Create fsdaxes with filesystem for test.
#  3. Clone and build `pmdk` and `pmdk-tests` repositories.
#  4. Mount fsdaxes by UUID to proper directories.
#  5. Create config file for RAS USL.
#  6. Run phase I of the test.
#  7. Perform power cycle by `ipmitool power cycle`.
#  8. Mount fsdaxes after server goes up.
#  9. Run phase II of the test.
#  10. Check if phase I and phase II were successful.
#
#  Cleanup stage contains:
#  1. Remove temporary files.
#
#  The test execution should result in two XML log files having been created on the DUT platform.
#  Those XMLs will be located in the /var/tmp/raslogs directory.
