# (string) This setting controls how duplicate definitions of dictionary variables (aka hash, map, associative array) are handled in Ansible.
# This does not affect variables whose values are scalars (integers, strings) or arrays.
# **WARNING**, changing this setting is not recommended as this is fragile and makes your content (plays, roles, collections) non portable, leading to continual confusion and misuse. Don't change this setting unless you think you have an absolute need for it.
# We recommend avoiding reusing variable names and relying on the ``combine`` filter and ``vars`` and ``varnames`` lookups to create merged versions of the individual variables. In our experience this is rarely really needed and a sign that too much complexity has been introduced into the data structures and plays.
# For some uses you can also look into custom vars_plugins to merge on input, even substituting the default ``host_group_vars`` that is in charge of parsing the ``host_vars/`` and ``group_vars/`` directories. Most users of this setting are only interested in inventory scope, but the setting itself affects all sources and makes debugging even harder.
# All playbooks and roles in the official examples repos assume the default for this setting.
# Changing the setting to ``merge`` applies across variable sources, but many sources will internally still overwrite the variables. For example ``include_vars`` will dedupe variables internally before updating Ansible, with 'last defined' overwriting previous definitions in same file.
# The Ansible project recommends you **avoid ``merge`` for new projects.**
# It is the intention of the Ansible developers to eventually deprecate and remove this setting, but it is being kept as some users do heavily rely on it. New projects should **avoid 'merge'**.

# (integer) For asynchronous tasks in Ansible (covered in Asynchronous Actions and Polling), this is how often to check back on the status of those tasks when an explicit poll interval is not supplied.

# (boolean) Toggle to control showing warnings related to running devel
;devel_warning=True

# (boolean) Normally ``ansible-playbook`` will print a header for each task that is run. These headers will contain the name: field from the task if you specified one. If you didn't then ``ansible-playbook`` uses the task's action to help you tell which task is presently running.

# (string) Path to the Python interpreter to be used for module execution on remote targets, or an automatic discovery mode. Supported discovery modes are ``auto`` (the default), ``auto_silent``, ``auto_legacy``, and ``auto_legacy_silent``. All discovery modes employ a lookup table to use the included system Python (on distributions known to include one), falling back to a fixed ordered list of well-known Python interpreter locations if a platform-specific default is not available. The fallback behavior will issue a warning that the interpreter should be set explicitly (since interpreters installed later may change which one is used). This warning behavior can be disabled by setting ``auto_silent`` or ``auto_legacy_silent``. The value of ``auto_legacy`` provides all the same behavior, but for backwards-compatibility with older Ansible releases that always defaulted to ``/usr/bin/python``, will use that interpreter if present.

# (integer) For asynchronous tasks in Ansible (covered in Asynchronous Actions and Polling), this is how long, in seconds, to wait for the task spawned by Ansible to connect back to the named pipe used on Windows systems. The default is 5 seconds. This can be too low on slower systems, or systems under heavy load.
# This is not the total time an async command can run for, but is a separate timeout to wait for an async command to start.

[connection]
# (boolean) This is a global option, each connection plugin can override either by having more specific options or not supporting pipelining at all.
# Pipelining, if supported by the connection plugin, reduces the number of network operations required to execute a module on the remote server, by executing many Ansible modules without actual file transfer.
# It can result in a very significant performance improvement when enabled.
# However this conflicts with privilege escalation (become). For example, when using 'sudo:' operations you must first disable 'requiretty' in /etc/sudoers on all managed hosts, which is why it is disabled by default.
