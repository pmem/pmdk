# This playbook is designed to configure SDLe scan host for pmem/pmdk.
# Examples below show how to use this file:
# 1) remotely
# export TARGET_IP= # ip of the target
# export USER_PASSWORD= # a password of non-root user on the target
# ansible-playbook -i $TARGET_IP, configure-SDLe.yml --extra-vars \
#   "host=all ansible_user=pmdkuser ansible_password=USER_PASSWORD"
#
# 2) locally
# For a playbook to be used on a local server please:
# a) comment out the first command: # -hosts: "{{ host }}"
# b) uncomment the next two lines:
# - hosts: localhost
#   connection: local
