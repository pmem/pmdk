# 1) remotely
# export TARGET_IP= # ip of the target
# export ROOT_PASSWORD= # a password of root on the target
# export GHA_TOKEN= # a GitHub token generated for a new self-hosted runner
# export HOST_NAME= # host's name that will be visible on GitHub

#   "host=all ansible_user=root ansible_password=$ROOT_PASSWORD testUser=pmdkuser \
#   runner_name=$HOST_NAME labels=$LABELS token=$GHA_TOKEN vars_gha=$VARS_GHA"
#
# 2) locally
# For a playbook to be used on a local server please:
# a) comment out the first command: # -hosts: "{{ host }}"
# b) uncomment the next two lines:
# - hosts: localhost
