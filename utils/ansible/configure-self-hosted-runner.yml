#   "host=all ansible_user=root ansible_password=$ROOT_PASSWORD testUser=pmdkuser \
#   runner_name=$HOST_NAME labels=$LABELS token=$GHA_TOKEN vars_gha=$VARS_GHA"

# 2) locally
# For a playbook to be used on a local server please:
# a) comment out the first command: # -hosts: "{{ host }}"
# b) uncomment the next two lines:
# - hosts: localhost
