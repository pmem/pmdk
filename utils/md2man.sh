# md2man.sh -- convert markdown to groff man pages
#
# usage: md2man.sh file license
#
# This script converts markdown file into groff man page using pandoc.
# It performs some pre- and post-processing for better results:
# - parse input file for YAML metadata block and read man page title,
#   section and version
# - cut-off metadata block and license
# - insert copyright header and license
# - unindent code blocks
