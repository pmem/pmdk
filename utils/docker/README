Persistent Memory Development Kit

This is utils/docker/README.

Scripts in this directory let Travis CI run a Docker container with ubuntu-
or fedora-based environment and build PMDK project inside it.

'build-local.sh' can be used to build PMDK locally.

'build-CI.sh' is used for building PMDK on Travis and GitHub Actions CIs

NOTE:
If you commit changes to any Dockerfile or shell script in the 'images'
subdirectory and then do git-rebase before pushing your commits to the
repository, make sure that you do not squash the commit which is the head in
your repository. This will let Travis and GitHub Actions CIs recreate
Docker images used during the build before the build. Otherwise the not-updated
Docker image will be pulled from the Docker Hub and used during the build on
Travis and GitHub Actions CIs.
