# NAME #

**pmempool_rmU**()/**pmempool_rmW**() - remove persistent memory pool


# SYNOPSIS #

```c
#include <libpmempool.h>

int pmempool_rmU(const char *path, int flags);
int pmempool_rmW(const wchar_t *path, int flags);
```


>NOTE: The PMDK API supports UNICODE. If the **PMDK_UTF8_API** macro is
defined, basic API functions are expanded to the UTF-8 API with postfix *U*.
Otherwise they are expanded to the UNICODE API with postfix *W*.


# DESCRIPTION #

The **pmempool_rmU**()/**pmempool_rmW**() function removes the pool pointed to by *path*. The *path*
can point to a regular file, device dax or pool set file. If *path* is a pool
set file, **pmempool_rmU**()/**pmempool_rmW**() will remove all part files from local replicas
using **unlink**(2) before removing the pool set file itself.

The *flags* argument determines the behavior of **pmempool_rmU**()/**pmempool_rmW**().
It is either 0 or the bitwise OR of one or more of the following flags:

+ **PMEMPOOL_RM_FORCE** - Ignore all errors when removing part files from
local replicas.

+ **PMEMPOOL_RM_POOLSET_LOCAL** - Also remove local pool set file.




# RETURN VALUE #

On success, **pmempool_rmU**()/**pmempool_rmW**() returns 0. On error, it returns -1 and sets
*errno* accordingly.


# SEE ALSO #
