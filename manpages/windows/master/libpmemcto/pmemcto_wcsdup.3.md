# NAME #

pmemcto_wcsdup - duplicate a wide-char string


# SYNOPSIS #

```c
#include <libpmemcto.h>

wchar_t *pmemcto_wcsdup(PMEMctopool *pcp, const wchar_t *s);
```


# DESCRIPTION #

The **pmemcto_wcsdup**() function provides the same semantics as **wcsdup**(3),
but operates on the memory pool *pcp* instead of the process heap supplied
by the system.  It returns a pointer to a new wide-char string which is
a duplicate of the string *s*.  Memory for the new string is obtained with
**pmemcto_malloc**(3), on the given memory pool, and can be freed with
**pmemcto_free**(3) on the same memory pool.


# RETURN VALUE #

On success, the **pmemcto_wcsdup**() function returns a pointer to
the duplicated string.  If **pmemcto_wcsdup**() is unable to satisfy the
allocation request, a NULL pointer is returned and *errno* is set appropriately.


# ERRORS #

**ENOMEM** Insufficient memory available to allocate duplicated string.


# SEE ALSO #

**pmemcto_malloc**(3), **pmemcto_strdup**(3),
