# NAME #

**pmemblk_read**(), **pmemblk_write**() - read or write a block from a block
memory pool


# SYNOPSIS #

```c
#include <libpmemblk.h>

int pmemblk_read(PMEMblkpool *pbp, void *buf, long long blockno);
int pmemblk_write(PMEMblkpool *pbp, const void *buf, long long blockno);
```


# DESCRIPTION #

The **pmemblk_read**() function reads the block with block number *blockno*
from memory pool *pbp* into the buffer *buf*. Reading a block that has never
been written by **pmemblk_write**() will return a block of zeroes.

The **pmemblk_write**() function writes a block from *buf* to block number
*blockno* in the memory pool *pbp*. The write is atomic with respect to other
reads and writes. In addition, the write cannot be torn by program failure or
system crash; on recovery the block is guaranteed to contain either the old
data or the new data, never a mixture of both.


# RETURN VALUE #

On success, the **pmemblk_read**() and **pmemblk_write**() functions return 0.
On error, they return -1 and set *errno* appropriately.
