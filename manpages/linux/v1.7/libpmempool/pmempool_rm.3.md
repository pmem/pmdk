# NAME #

**pmempool_rm**() - remove persistent memory pool


# SYNOPSIS #

```c
#include <libpmempool.h>

int pmempool_rm(const char *path, int flags);
```




# DESCRIPTION #

The **pmempool_rm**() function removes the pool pointed to by *path*. The *path*
can point to a regular file, device dax or pool set file. If *path* is a pool
set file, **pmempool_rm**() will remove all part files from local replicas
using **unlink**(2), and all remote replicas using **rpmem_remove**(3)
(see **librpmem**(7)), before removing the pool set file itself.

The *flags* argument determines the behavior of **pmempool_rm**().
It is either 0 or the bitwise OR of one or more of the following flags:

+ **PMEMPOOL_RM_FORCE** - Ignore all errors when removing part files from
local or remote replicas.

+ **PMEMPOOL_RM_POOLSET_LOCAL** - Also remove local pool set file.

+ **PMEMPOOL_RM_POOLSET_REMOTE** - Also remove remote pool set file.


# RETURN VALUE #

On success, **pmempool_rm**() returns 0. On error, it returns -1 and sets
*errno* accordingly.


# SEE ALSO #
