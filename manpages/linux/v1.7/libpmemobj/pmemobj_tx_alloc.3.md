# DESCRIPTION #

The **pmemobj_tx_alloc**() function transactionally allocates a new object of
given *size* and *type_num*. In contrast to the non-transactional allocations,
the objects are added to the internal object containers of given *type_num*
only after the transaction is committed, making the objects visible to the
**POBJ_FOREACH_\***() macros. This function must be called during
**TX_STAGE_WORK**.

The **pmemobj_tx_zalloc**() function transactionally allocates a new zeroed
object of given *size* and *type_num*. This function must be called during
**TX_STAGE_WORK**.

The **pmemobj_tx_xalloc**() function transactionally allocates a new object
of given *size* and *type_num*. The *flags* argument is a bitmask of the
following values:

+ **POBJ_XALLOC_ZERO** - zero the allocated object (equivalent of pmemobj_tx_zalloc)

+ **POBJ_XALLOC_NO_FLUSH** - skip flush on commit
(when application deals with flushing or uses pmemobj_memcpy_persist)

+ **POBJ_CLASS_ID(class_id)** - allocate an object from the allocation
class with id equal to *class_id*

+ **POBJ_ARENA_ID(arena_id)** - allocate an object from the arena specified by
*arena_id*. The arena must exist, otherwise, the behavior is undefined.
If *arena_id* is equal 0, then arena assigned to the current thread will be used.

This function must be called during **TX_STAGE_WORK**.

The **pmemobj_tx_realloc**() function transactionally resizes an existing
object to the given *size* and changes its type to *type_num*. If *oid* is
**OID_NULL**, then the call is equivalent to *pmemobj_tx_alloc(pop, size,
type_num)*. If *size* is equal to zero and *oid* is not **OID_NULL**, then
the call is equivalent to *pmemobj_tx_free(oid)*. If the new size is larger
than the old size, the added memory will *not* be initialized. This function
must be called during **TX_STAGE_WORK**.

The **pmemobj_tx_zrealloc**() function transactionally resizes an existing
object to the given *size* and changes its type to *type_num*. If the new
size is larger than the old size, the extended new space is zeroed. This
function must be called during **TX_STAGE_WORK**.

The **pmemobj_tx_strdup**() function transactionally allocates a new object
containing a duplicate of the string *s* and assigns it a type *type_num*.
This function must be called during **TX_STAGE_WORK**.

The **pmemobj_tx_wcsdup**() function transactionally allocates a new object
containing a duplicate of the wide character string *s* and assigns it a type
*type_num*. This function must be called during **TX_STAGE_WORK**.

The **pmemobj_tx_free**() function transactionally frees an existing object
referenced by *oid*. This function must be called during **TX_STAGE_WORK**.

The **TX_NEW**() macro transactionally allocates a new object of given *TYPE*
and assigns it a type number read from the typed *OID*. The allocation size is
determined from the size of the user-defined structure *TYPE*. If successful
and called during **TX_STAGE_WORK** it returns a handle to the newly allocated
object. Otherwise, the stage is changed to **TX_STAGE_ONABORT**, **OID_NULL**
is returned, and *errno* is set appropriately.

The **TX_ALLOC**() macro transactionally allocates a new object of given *TYPE*
and assigns it a type number read from the typed *OID*. The allocation size is
passed by *size* parameter. If successful and called during **TX_STAGE_WORK**
it returns a handle to the newly allocated object. Otherwise, the stage is set
to **TX_STAGE_ONABORT**, **OID_NULL** is returned, and *errno* is set
appropriately.

The **TX_ZNEW**() macro transactionally allocates a new zeroed object of given
*TYPE* and assigns it a type number read from the typed *OID*. The allocation
size is determined from the size of the user-defined structure *TYPE*. If
successful and called during **TX_STAGE_WORK** it returns a handle to the newly
allocated object. Otherwise, stage changes to **TX_STAGE_ONABORT**, **OID_NULL**
is returned, and *errno* is set appropriately.

The **TX_ZALLOC**() macro transactionally allocates a new zeroed object of
given *TYPE* and assigns it a type number read from the typed *OID*. The
allocation size is passed by *size* argument. If successful and called during
**TX_STAGE_WORK** it returns a handle to the newly allocated object. Otherwise,
the stage is changed to **TX_STAGE_ONABORT**, **OID_NULL** is returned, and
*errno* is set appropriately.

The **TX_XALLOC**() macro transactionally allocates a new object of given
*TYPE* and assigns it a type number read from the typed *OID*. The allocation
size is passed by *size* argument. The *flags* argument is a bitmask of values
described in **pmemobj_tx_xalloc** section. If successful and called during
**TX_STAGE_WORK** it returns a handle to the newly allocated object. Otherwise,
the stage is changed to **TX_STAGE_ONABORT**, **OID_NULL** is returned, and
*errno* is set appropriately.

The **TX_REALLOC**() macro transactionally resizes an existing object
referenced by a handle *o* to the given *size*. If successful and called during
**TX_STAGE_WORK** it returns a handle to the reallocated object. Otherwise, the
stage is changed to **TX_STAGE_ONABORT**, **OID_NULL** is returned, and *errno*
is set appropriately.

The **TX_ZREALLOC**() macro transactionally resizes an existing object
referenced by a handle *o* to the given *size*. If the new size is larger than
the old size, the extended new space is zeroed. If successful and called during
**TX_STAGE_WORK** it returns a handle to the reallocated object. Otherwise, the
stage is changed to **TX_STAGE_ONABORT**, **OID_NULL** is returned, and *errno*
is set appropriately.

The **TX_STRDUP**() macro transactionally allocates a new object containing a
duplicate of the string *s* and assigns it type *type_num*. If successful and
called during **TX_STAGE_WORK** it returns a handle to the newly allocated
object. Otherwise, the stage is changed to **TX_STAGE_ONABORT**, **OID_NULL**
is returned, and *errno* is set appropriately.

The **TX_WCSDUP**() macro transactionally allocates a new object containing a
duplicate of the wide character string *s* and assigns it a type *type_num*. If
successful and called during **TX_STAGE_WORK**, it returns a handle to the
newly allocated object. Otherwise, the stage is changed to **TX_STAGE_ONABORT**,
**OID_NULL** is returned, and *errno* is set appropriately.

The **TX_FREE**() macro transactionally frees the memory space represented by
an object handle *o*. If *o* is **OID_NULL**, no operation is performed. If
successful and called during **TX_STAGE_WORK**, **TX_FREE**() returns 0.
Otherwise, the stage is changed to **TX_STAGE_ONABORT** and an error number is
returned.


# RETURN VALUE #

On success, the **pmemobj_tx_alloc**() ,**pmemobj_tx_zalloc**(),
**pmemobj_tx_xalloc**(), **pmemobj_tx_strdup**() and **pmemobj_tx_wcsdup**()
functions return a handle to the newly allocated object. Otherwise, the stage
is changed to **TX_STAGE_ONABORT**, **OID_NULL** is returned, and *errno* is
set appropriately. If *size* equals 0, **OID_NULL** is returned and *errno* is
set appropriately.

On success, **pmemobj_tx_realloc**() and **pmemobj_tx_zrealloc**() return
a handle to the resized object. Otherwise, the stage is changed to
**TX_STAGE_ONABORT**, **OID_NULL** is returned, and *errno* is set
appropriately. Note that the object handle value may change as a result of
reallocation.

On success, **pmemobj_tx_free**() returns 0. Otherwise, the stage is set
to **TX_STAGE_ONABORT** and an error number is returned.
