# DESCRIPTION #

**libvmmalloc** transparently converts all the dynamic memory allocations into Persistent Memory allocations.

The typical usage of **libvmmalloc** does not require any modification of the target program. It is enough to load **libvmmalloc** before all other libraries
by setting the environment variable **LD_PRELOAD**. When used in that way, **libvmmalloc** interposes the standard system memory allocation routines, as defined
in **malloc**(3), **posix_memalign**(3) and **malloc_usable_size**(3), and provides that all dynamic memory allocations are made from a *memory pool* built on
memory-mapped file, instead of a system heap. The memory managed by **libvmmalloc** may have different attributes, depending on the file system containing the
memory-mapped file. In particular, **libvmmalloc** is part of the *Non-Volatile Memory Library* because it is sometimes useful to use non-volatile memory as a
volatile memory pool, leveraging its capacity, cost, or performance characteristics.

**libvmmalloc** may be also linked to the program, by providing the **-lvmmalloc** argument to the linker. Then it becomes the default memory allocator for given
program.

>NOTE:
Due to the fact the library operates on a memory-mapped file, **it may not work properly with the programs that perform fork(3) not followed by
exec(3).**
There are two variants of experimental **fork**() support available in libvmmalloc. The desired library behavior may be selected by setting **VMMALLOC_FORK**
environment variable. By default variant #1 is enabled. See **ENVIRONMENT** section for more details.

**libvmmalloc** uses the **mmap**(2) system call to create a pool of volatile memory. The library is most useful when used with *Direct Access* storage (DAX),
which is memory-addressable persistent storage that supports load/store access without being paged via the system page cache. A Persistent Memory-aware file
system is typically used to provide this type of access. Memory-mapping a file from a Persistent Memory-aware file system provides the raw memory pools, and
this library supplies the traditional *malloc* interfaces on top of those pools.

The memory pool acting as a system heap replacement is created automatically at the library initialization time. User may control its location and size by
setting the environment variables described in **ENVIRONMENT** section. The allocated file space is reclaimed when process terminates or in case of system
crash.

Under normal usage, **libvmmalloc** will never print messages or intentionally cause the process to exit. The library uses **pthreads**(7) to be fully MT-safe,
but never creates or destroys threads itself. The library does not make use of any signals, networking, and never calls **select**() or **poll**().


# ENVIRONMENT #

There are two configuration variables that **must** be set to make **libvmmalloc** work properly. If any of them is not specified, or if their values are not
valid, the library prints the appropriate error message and terminates the process.

+ **VMMALLOC_POOL_DIR**=*path*

Specifies a path to directory where the memory pool file should be created. The directory must exist and be writable.

+ **VMMALLOC_POOL_SIZE**=*len*

Defines the desired size (in bytes) of the memory pool file. It must be not less than the minimum allowed size **VMMALLOC_MIN_POOL** as defined in
**\<libvmmalloc.h\>**.

>NOTE:
Due to the fact the library adds some metadata to the memory pool, the amount of actual usable space is typically less than the size of the memory
pool file.

+ **VMMALLOC_FORK**=*val*

Setting the **VMMALLOC_FORK** configuration variable is optional. It controls the behavior of **libvmmalloc** in case of **fork**(3), and can be set to the
following values:

+ **0** - fork() support is disabled. The behavior is undefined in such case, but most likely results in the memory pool corruption and the program crash due to
segmentation fault.

+ **1** - The memory pool file is remapped with **MAP_PRIVATE** flag before the fork completes. From this moment, any access to memory that modifies the heap
pages, both in the parent and in the child process, will trigger creation of a copy of those pages in RAM (copy-on-write). The benefit of such approach is that
it does not significantly increase the time of fork operation, and does not require additional space on the file system. However, all the subsequent memory
allocations and modifications of the memory allocated before fork, will consume system memory resources instead of the memory pool.

+ **2** - A copy of the entire memory pool file is created for the use of the child process. This requires additional space on the file system, but both the
parent and the child process may still operate on their memory pools, not consuming the system memory resources.

>NOTE:
In case of large memory pools, creating a copy of the pool file may stall the fork operation for a quite long time.

+ **3** - The library first attempts to create a copy of the memory pool (as for option #2), but if it fails (i.e. because of insufficient amount of free space
on the file system), it will fall back to option #1.


# CAVEATS #

**libvmmalloc** relies on the library destructor being called from the main
thread. For this reason, all functions that might trigger destruction (e.g.
**dlclose**()) should be called in the main thread. Otherwise some of the
resources associated with that thread might not be cleaned up properly.


# DEBUGGING #

Two versions of **libvmmalloc** are typically available on a development system. The normal version is optimized for performance. That version skips checks
that impact performance and never logs any trace information or performs any run-time assertions. A second version, accessed when using the libraries under
**/usr/lib/nvml_debug**, contains run-time assertions and trace points. The typical way to access the debug version is to set the environment variable
**LD_LIBRARY_PATH** to **/usr/lib/nvml_debug** or **/usr/lib64/nvml_debug** depending on where the debug libraries are installed on the system. The trace points
in the debug version of the library are enabled using the environment variable **VMMALLOC_LOG_LEVEL** which can be set to the following values:

+ **0** - Tracing is disabled. This is the default level when **VMMALLOC_LOG_LEVEL** is not set.

+ **1** - Additional details on any errors detected are logged (in addition to returning the *errno*-based errors as usual).

+ **2** - A trace of basic operations is logged.

+ **3** - This level enables a very verbose amount of function call tracing in the library.

+ **4** - This level enables voluminous tracing information about all the memory allocations and deallocations.

The environment variable **VMMALLOC_LOG_FILE** specifies a file name where all logging information should be written. If the last character in the name is "-",
the PID of the current process will be appended to the file name when the log file is created. If **VMMALLOC_LOG_FILE** is not set, output goes to stderr.

Setting the environment variable **VMMALLOC_LOG_LEVEL** has no effect on the non-debug version of **libvmmalloc**.

+ **VMMALLOC_LOG_STATS**=1

Setting this environment variable to 1 enables logging the human-readable summary statistics at the program termination. Statistics are written only for the
debug version of **libvmmalloc**.


# NOTES #

Unlike the normal **malloc**(), which asks the system for additional memory when it runs out, **libvmmalloc** allocates the size it is told to and never
attempts to grow or shrink that memory pool.


# BUGS #

**libvmmalloc** may not work properly with the programs that perform **fork**(3) and do not call **exec**(3) immediately afterwards. See **ENVIRONMENT**
section for more details about the experimental **fork**() support.

If the trace points in the debug version of the library are enabled and the process performs fork, there is no new log file created for the child process, even
if the configured log file name is terminated with "-" character. All the logging information from the child process will be written to the log file owned by
the parent process, which may lead to corruption or partial loss of the log data.

Malloc hooks (see **malloc_hook**(3)), are not supported when using **libvmmalloc**.


# ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS #

**libvmmalloc** depends on jemalloc, written by Jason Evans, to do the heavy lifting of managing dynamic memory allocation. See:
