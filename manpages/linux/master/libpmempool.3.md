# DESCRIPTION #

**libpmempool**
provides a set of utilities for off-line analysis and
manipulation of a *pool*. By *pool* in this
manpage we mean pmemobj pool, pmemblk pool, pmemlog pool or
BTT layout, independent of the underlying storage. Some of
**libpmempool** functions are required to work without
any impact on processed *pool* but some of them may
create a new or modify an existing one.

**libpmempool**
is for applications that need high reliability or built-in
troubleshooting. It may be useful for testing and debugging
purposes also.

# POOL CHECKING FUNCTIONS #

To perform check provided by **libpmempool**, a *check context*
must be first initialized using **pmempool_check_init**()
function described in this section. Once initialized
*check context* is represented by an opaque handle, of
type *PMEMpoolcheck\**, which is passed to all of the
other functions described in this section.

To execute check **pmempool_check**() must be called iteratively.
Each call resumes check till new status will be generated.
Each status is represented by *struct pmempool_check_status\** structure.
It may carry various
types of messages described in this section.

When check is completed **pmempool_check**() returns NULL pointer.
Check must be finalized using **pmempool_check_end**().
It returns *enum pmempool_check_result* describing
result of the whole check.

# NOTE #
Currently, checking the consistency of a *pmemobj* pool is **not** supported.

```c
PMEMpoolcheck *pmempool_check_init(struct pmempool_check_args *args,
	size_t args_size);
```

The **pmempool_check_init**() initializes check
context. *args* describes parameters of the
check context. *args_size* should be equal to
the size of the *struct pmempool_check_args*.
*struct pmempool_check_args* is defined as follows:

```c
struct pmempool_check_args
{
	/* path to the pool to check */
	const char *path;

	/* optional backup path */
	const char *backup_path;

	/* type of the pool */
	enum pmempool_pool_type pool_type;

	/* parameters */
	int flags;
};
```
The *flags* argument accepts any combination of the following values (ORed):

+ **PMEMPOOL_CHECK_REPAIR** - perform repairs
+ **PMEMPOOL_CHECK_DRY_RUN** - emulate repairs, not supported on Device DAX
+ **PMEMPOOL_CHECK_ADVANCED** - perform hazardous repairs
+ **PMEMPOOL_CHECK_ALWAYS_YES** - do not ask before repairs
+ **PMEMPOOL_CHECK_VERBOSE** - generate info statuses
+ **PMEMPOOL_CHECK_FORMAT_STR** - generate string format statuses

If provided parameters are invalid or initialization process fails
**pmempool_check_init**() returns NULL and sets *errno*
appropriately. *pool_type* has to match type of the
*pool* being processed. You can turn on pool type
detection by setting *pool_type* to **PMEMPOOL_POOL_TYPE_DETECT**.
Pool type detection fail ends check.

*backup_path* argument can either be:

+ NULL. It indicates no backup will be performed.

+ a non existing file. It is valid only in case *path* is a single file
*pool*. It indicates a *backup_path* file will be created and backup will be
performed.

+ an existing *pool set* file of the same structure (the same number of parts
with exactly the same size) as the source *pool set*. It is valid only in case
*path* is a *pool set*. It indicates backup will be performed in a form
described by the *backup_path* *pool set*.

Backup is supported only if the source *pool set* has no defined replicas.

Pool sets with remote replicas are not supported neither as *path* nor as
*backup_path*.

This is an example of a *check context* initialization:

```c
struct pmempool_check_args args =
{
	.path = "/path/to/blk.pool",
	.backup_path = NULL,
	.pool_type = PMEMPOOL_POOL_TYPE_BLK,
	.flags = PMEMPOOL_CHECK_REPAIR | PMEMPOOL_CHECK_DRY_RUN |
		PMEMPOOL_CHECK_VERBOSE | PMEMPOOL_CHECK_FORMAT_STR
};
```

```c
PMEMpoolcheck *ppc = pmempool_check_init(&args, sizeof(args));
```

The check will process a *pool* of type **PMEMPOOL_POOL_TYPE_BLK**
located in the path */path/to/blk.pool*. Before check it will
not create a backup of the *pool* (*backup_path == NULL*).
If the check will find any issues it will try to
perform repair steps (**PMEMPOOL_CHECK_REPAIR**), but it
will not make any changes to the *pool*
(**PMEMPOOL_CHECK_DRY_RUN**) and it will not perform any
dangerous repair steps (no **PMEMPOOL_CHECK_ADVANCED**).
The check will ask before performing any repair steps (no
**PMEMPOOL_CHECK_ALWAYS_YES**). It will also generate
detailed information about the check (**PMEMPOOL_CHECK_VERBOSE**).
**PMEMPOOL_CHECK_FORMAT_STR** flag indicates string
format statuses (*struct pmempool_check_status*).
Currently it is the only supported status format so this flag is required.

```c
struct pmempool_check_status *pmempool_check(PMEMpoolcheck *ppc);
```

The **pmempool_check**() function starts or resumes the check
indicated by *ppc*. When next status will be generated
it pauses the check and returns a pointer to the
*struct pmempool_check_status* structure:

```c
struct pmempool_check_status
{
	enum pmempool_check_msg_type type; /* type of the status */
	struct
	{
		const char *msg; /* status message string */
		const char *answer; /* answer to message if applicable */
	} str;
};
```

This structure can describe three types of statuses:

+ **PMEMPOOL_CHECK_MSG_TYPE_INFO** - detailed information about the check.
  Generated only if a **PMEMPOOL_CHECK_VERBOSE** flag was set.
+ **PMEMPOOL_CHECK_MSG_TYPE_ERROR** - encountered error
+ **PMEMPOOL_CHECK_MSG_TYPE_QUESTION** - question. Generated only if an
  **PMEMPOOL_CHECK_ALWAYS_YES** flag was not set. It requires *answer* to be
  set to "yes" or "no" before continuing.

After calling **pmempool_check**() again the previously provided
*struct pmempool_check_status\** pointer must be
considered invalid. When the check completes
**pmempool_check**() returns NULL pointer.

```c
enum pmempool_check_result pmempool_check_end(PMEMpoolcheck* ppc);
```

The **pmempool_check_end**() function finalizes the check and
releases all related resources. *ppc* is not a valid
pointer after calling **pmempool_check_end**(). It
returns *enum pmempool_check_result* summarizing result
of the finalized check. **pmempool_check_end**() can
return one of the following values:

+ **PMEMPOOL_CHECK_RESULT_CONSISTENT** - the *pool* is consistent
+ **PMEMPOOL_CHECK_RESULT_NOT_CONSISTENT** - the *pool* is not consistent
+ **PMEMPOOL_CHECK_RESULT_REPAIRED** - the *pool* has issues but all repair
  steps completed successfully
+ **PMEMPOOL_CHECK_RESULT_CANNOT_REPAIR** - the *pool* has issues which
  can not be repaired
+ **PMEMPOOL_CHECK_RESULT_ERROR** - the *pool* has errors or the check
  encountered issue


# POOL SET SYNCHRONIZATION AND TRANSFORMATION #

### POOL SET SYNC ###

```c
int pmempool_sync(const char *poolset_file, unsigned flags); (EXPERIMENTAL)
```

The **pmempool_sync**() function synchronizes data between replicas within
a pool set.

**pmempool_sync**() accepts two arguments:

* *poolset_file* - a path to a pool set file,

* *flags* - a combination of flags (ORed) which modify the way of
synchronization.

>NOTE: Only the pool set file used to create the pool should be used
for syncing the pool.

The following flags are available:

* **PMEMPOOL_DRY_RUN** - do not apply changes, only check for viability of
synchronization.

**pmempool_sync**() function checks if metadata of all replicas in a pool set
are consistent, i.e. all parts are healthy, and if any of them is not,
the corrupted or missing parts are recreated and filled with data from one of
the healthy replicas.

The function returns either 0 on success or -1 in case of error
with proper errno set accordingly.

>NOTE: The **pmempool_sync**() API is experimental and it may change in future
versions of the library.

### POOL SET TRANSFORM ###

```c
int pmempool_transform(const char *poolset_file_src,
	const char *poolset_file_dst,
	unsigned flags); (EXPERIMENTAL)
```

The **pmempool_transform**() function modifies internal structure of a pool set.
It supports the following operations:

* adding one or more replicas,

* removing one or more replicas,

* reordering of replicas.

Currently these operations are allowed only for **pmemobj** pools (see
**libpmemobj**(3)).


**pmempool_transform**() accepts three arguments:

* *poolset_file_src* - a path to a pool set file which defines the source
pool set to be changed,

* *poolset_file_dst* - a path to a pool set file which defines the target
structure of the pool set,

* *flags* - a combination of flags (ORed) which modify the way of
synchronization.

The following flags are available:

* **PMEMPOOL_DRY_RUN** - do not apply changes, only check for viability of
synchronization.

When adding or deleting replicas, the two pool set files can differ only in the
definitions of replicas which are to be added or deleted. One cannot add and
remove replicas in the same step. Only one of these operations can be performed
at a time. Reordering replicas can be combined with any of them.
Also, to add a replica it is necessary for its effective size to match or exceed
the pool size. Otherwise the whole operation fails and no changes are applied.
Effective size of a replica is the sum of sizes of all its part files decreased
by 4096 bytes per each part file. The 4096 bytes of each part file is
utilized for storing internal metadata of the pool part files.

The function returns either 0 on success or -1 in case of error
with proper *errno* set accordingly.

>NOTE: The **pmempool_transform**() API is experimental and it may change in future
versions of the library.

# POOL SET MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS: #

### Removing pool ###

```c
int pmempool_rm(const char *path, int flags);
```

The **pmempool_rm**() function removes pool pointed by *path*. The *path* can
point to either a regular file, device dax or pool set file. In case of pool
set file the **pmempool_rm**() will remove all part files from local replicas
using **unlink**(3) and all remote replicas (supported on Linux)
using **rpmem_remove**() function (see **librpmem**(3)),
before removing the pool set file itself.

The *flags* argument determines the behavior of **pmempool_rm**() function.
It is either 0 or the bitwise OR of one or more of the following flags:

+ **PMEMPOOL_RM_FORCE**
Ignore all errors when removing part files from local replicas or remote
replica.

+ **PMEMPOOL_RM_POOLSET_LOCAL**
Remove also local pool set file.

+ **PMEMPOOL_RM_POOLSET_REMOTE**
Remove also remote pool set file.


# CAVEATS #

**libpmempool** relies on the library destructor being called from the main
thread. For this reason, all functions that might trigger destruction (e.g.
**dlclose**()) should be called in the main thread. Otherwise some of the
resources associated with that thread might not be cleaned up properly.


# LIBRARY API VERSIONING #

This section describes how the library API is versioned, allowing
applications to work with an evolving API.

```c
const char *pmempool_check_version(
	unsigned major_required,
	unsigned minor_required);
```

The **pmempool_check_version**() function is used to see if
the installed **libpmempool** supports the version of the
library API required by an application. The easiest way to
do this for the application is to supply the compile-time
version information, supplied by defines in **\<libpmempool.h\>**, like this:

```c
reason = pmempool_check_version(PMEMPOOL_MAJOR_VERSION,
                                PMEMPOOL_MINOR_VERSION);
if (reason != NULL) {
	/* version check failed, reason string tells you why */
}
```

Any mismatch in the major version number is considered a failure, but a
library with a newer minor version number will pass this
check since increasing minor versions imply backwards compatibility.

An application can also check specifically for the existence of an
interface by checking for the version where that interface
was introduced. These versions are documented in this man
page as follows: unless otherwise specified, all interfaces
described here are available in version 1.0 of the library.
Interfaces added after version 1.0 will contain the text
*introduced in version x.y* in the section of this manual
describing the feature.

When the version check performed by **pmempool_check_version**()
is successful, the return value is NULL. Otherwise the
return value is a static string describing the reason for
failing the version check. The string returned by
**pmempool_check_version**() must not be modified or freed.


# DEBUGGING AND ERROR HANDLING #

Two versions of libpmempool are typically available on a development
system. The normal version, accessed when a program is
linked using the **-lpmempool** option, is optimized for
performance. That version skips checks that impact
performance and exceptionally logs any trace information or
performs any run-time assertions. If an error is detected
during the call to **libpmempool** function, an
application may retrieve an error message describing the
reason of failure using the following function:

```c
const char *pmempool_errormsg(void);
```

The **pmempool_errormsg**() function returns a pointer to a
static buffer containing the last error message logged for
current thread. The error message may include description of
the corresponding error code (if *errno* was set), as returned
by **strerror**(3). The error message buffer is
thread-local; errors encountered in one thread do not affect
its value in other threads. The buffer is never cleared by
any library function; its content is significant only when
the return value of the immediately preceding call to
**libpmempool** function indicated an error, or if *errno*
was set. The application must not modify or free the error
message string, but it may be modified by subsequent calls
to other library functions.

A second version of **libpmempool**, accessed when a program uses
the libraries under **/usr/lib/nvml_debug**, contains
run-time assertions and trace points. The typical way to
access the debug version is to set the environment variable
**LD_LIBRARY_PATH** to **/usr/lib/nvml_debug** or **/usr/lib64/nvml_debug** depending on where the debug
libraries are installed on the system.
The trace points in
the debug version of the library are enabled using the
environment variable **PMEMPOOL_LOG_LEVEL**, which can be
set to the following values:

+ **0** - This is the default level when **PMEMPOOL_LOG_LEVEL** is not set.
No log messages are emitted at this level.

+ **1** - Additional details on any errors detected are logged (in addition to
returning the *errno*-based errors as usual). The same information may be
retrieved using **pmempool_errormsg**().

+ **2** - A trace of basic operations is logged.

+ **3** - This level enables a very verbose amount of function call tracing in
the library.

+ **4** - This level enables voluminous and fairly obscure tracing information
that is likely only useful to the libpmempool developers.

The environment variable **PMEMPOOL_LOG_FILE** specifies a file name
where all logging information should be written. If the last
character in the name is "-", the PID of the
current process will be appended to the file name when the
log file is created. If **PMEMPOOL_LOG_FILE** is not set,
the logging output goes to stderr.

Setting the environment variable **PMEMPOOL_LOG_FILE** has no effect
on the non-debug version of **libpmempool**.


# EXAMPLE #

The following example illustrates how the **libpmempool** API is used.
The program detects the type and checks consistency of given pool.
If there are any issues detected, the pool is automatically repaired.

```c
#include <stddef.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <libpmempool.h>

#define PATH "./pmem-fs/myfile"
#define CHECK_FLAGS (PMEMPOOL_CHECK_FORMAT_STR|PMEMPOOL_CHECK_REPAIR|\
                     PMEMPOOL_CHECK_VERBOSE)

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	PMEMpoolcheck *ppc;
	struct pmempool_check_status *status;
	enum pmempool_check_result ret;

	/* arguments for check */
	struct pmempool_check_args args = {
		.path		= PATH,
		.backup_path	= NULL,
		.pool_type	= PMEMPOOL_POOL_TYPE_DETECT,
		.flags		= CHECK_FLAGS
	};

	/* initialize check context */
	if ((ppc = pmempool_check_init(&args, sizeof(args))) == NULL) {
		perror("pmempool_check_init");
		exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
	}

	/* perform check and repair, answer 'yes' for each question */
	while ((status = pmempool_check(ppc)) != NULL) {
		switch (status->type) {
		case PMEMPOOL_CHECK_MSG_TYPE_ERROR:
			printf("%s\n", status->str.msg);
			break;
		case PMEMPOOL_CHECK_MSG_TYPE_INFO:
			printf("%s\n", status->str.msg);
			break;
		case PMEMPOOL_CHECK_MSG_TYPE_QUESTION:
			printf("%s\n", status->str.msg);
			status->str.answer = "yes";
			break;
		default:
			pmempool_check_end(ppc);
			exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
		}
	}

	/* finalize the check and get the result */
	ret = pmempool_check_end(ppc);
	switch (ret) {
		case PMEMPOOL_CHECK_RESULT_CONSISTENT:
		case PMEMPOOL_CHECK_RESULT_REPAIRED:
			return 0;
		default:
			return 1;
	}
}
```
