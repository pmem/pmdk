Persistent Memory Development Kit

This is doc/README.

Subdirectories of this directory contain source for the man pages for the
Persistent Memory Development Kit in markdown format (.md files).
If you're looking for documentation to
get you started using PMDK, start here: https://pmem.io/pmdk and follow the
links to examples and man pages. Developers new to PMDK are probably looking
for libpmemobj.

All files in the *generated* directory are automatically generated and updated
by the pmdk-bot. **DO NOT MODIFY THE FILES IN THAT DIRECTORY**. All changes to
the documentation must be made by modifying the *.md files in the following
document subdirectories:

libpmem -- low-level persistent memory support
libpmem2 -- low-level persistent memory support
libpmemobj -- transactional object store
libpmempool -- persistent memory pool management library
pmempool -- persistent memory pool management tool
daxio -- perform I/O on Device DAX device

These man pages provide the API specification for the corresponding libraries
and commands in this source tree, so any updates to one should be tested,
reviewed, and committed with changes to the other.

To create more readable text files from the source, use:
	$ [g]make

NOTE: This will write man page output into the *generated* subdirectory. Files
in this directory MUST NOT be included in any pull requests.

The man(1) command may be used to format generated man pages for viewing
in a terminal window (includes bold, underline, etc.), for example:
	$ man generated/libpmem.7
	$ man generated/pmemobj_create.3
