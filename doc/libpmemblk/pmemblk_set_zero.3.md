# NAME #

**pmemblk_set_zero**(), **pmemblk_set_error**() --  block management functions


# SYNOPSIS #

```c
#include <libpmemblk.h>

int pmemblk_set_zero(PMEMblkpool *pbp, long long blockno);
int pmemblk_set_error(PMEMblkpool *pbp, long long blockno);
```


# DESCRIPTION #

The **pmemblk_set_zero**() function writes zeros to block number *blockno* in
persistent memory resident array of blocks *pbp*. Using this function is faster
than actually writing a block of zeros since **libpmemblk**(7) uses metadata to
indicate the block should read back as zero.

The **pmemblk_set_error**() function sets the error state for block number
*blockno* in persistent memory resident array of blocks *pbp*.
A block in the error state returns *errno* **EIO** when read.
Writing the block clears the error state and returns the block to normal use.

# RETURN VALUE #

On success,  **pmemblk_set_zero**() and **pmemblk_set_error**() return 0.
On error, they return -1 and set *errno* appropriately.
