pmemcto_stats_print \-\- write human\-readable memory pool statistics
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#include\ <libpmemcto.h>

void\ pmemcto_stats_print(PMEMctopool\ *pcp,\ const\ char\ *opts);
\f[]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]pmemcto_stats_print\f[]() function produces messages containing
statistics about the given memory pool.
The output is printed using \f[B]libpmemcto\f[]\[aq]s internal
\f[I]print_func\f[] function (see \f[B]pmemcto_set_funcs\f[](3)).
That means the output typically appears on \f[I]stderr\f[] unless the
caller supplies a replacement \f[I]print_func\f[] or sets the
environment variable \f[B]PMEMCTO_LOG_FILE\f[] to direct output
elsewhere.
The \f[I]opts\f[] string can either be NULL or it can contain a list of
options that change the stats printed.
General information that never changes during execution can be omitted
by specifying "g" as a character within the opts string.
The characters "m" and "a" can be specified to omit merged arena and per
arena statistics, respectively; "b" and "l" can be specified to omit per
size class statistics for bins and large objects, respectively.
Unrecognized characters are silently ignored.
Note that thread caching may prevent some statistics from being
completely up to date.
See \f[B]jemalloc\f[](3) for more detail (the description of the
available \f[I]opts\f[] above was taken from that man page).
.SH ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
.PP
\f[B]libpmemcto\f[] depends on jemalloc, written by Jason Evans, to do
the heavy lifting of managing dynamic memory allocation.
See: <http://www.canonware.com/jemalloc>
.PP
\f[B]libpmemcto\f[] builds on the persistent memory programming model
recommended by the SNIA NVM Programming Technical Work Group:
