pmemcto_aligned_alloc \[en] allocate aligned memory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#include\ <libpmemcto.h>

void\ *pmemcto_aligned_alloc(PMEMctopool\ *pcp,\ size_t\ alignment,\ size_t\ size);
\f[]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]pmemcto_aligned_alloc\f[]() function provides the same
semantics as \f[B]aligned_alloc\f[](3), but operates on the memory pool
\f[I]pcp\f[] instead of the process heap supplied by the system.
It allocates \f[I]size\f[] bytes from the memory pool and returns a
pointer to the allocated memory.
The memory is not zeroed.
The memory address will be a multiple of \f[I]alignment\f[], which must
be a power of two.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
On success, \f[B]pmemcto_aligned_alloc\f[]() function returns a pointer
to the allocated memory.
If \f[I]size\f[] is 0, then \f[B]pmemcto_aligned_alloc\f[]() returns
either NULL, or a unique pointer value that can later be successfully
passed to \f[B]pmemcto_free\f[](3).
If \f[B]pmemcto_aligned_alloc\f[]() is unable to satisfy the allocation
request, a NULL pointer is returned and \f[I]errno\f[] is set
appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
\f[B]EINVAL\f[] \f[I]alignment\f[] was not a power of two.
.PP
\f[B]ENOMEM\f[] Insufficient memory available to satisfy allocation
request.
