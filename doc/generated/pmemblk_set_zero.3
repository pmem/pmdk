\f[B]pmemblk_set_zero\f[](), \f[B]pmemblk_set_error\f[]() \- block
management functions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#include\ <libpmemblk.h>

int\ pmemblk_set_zero(PMEMblkpool\ *pbp,\ long\ long\ blockno);
int\ pmemblk_set_error(PMEMblkpool\ *pbp,\ long\ long\ blockno);
\f[]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]pmemblk_set_zero\f[]() function writes zeros to block number
\f[I]blockno\f[] in persistent memory resident array of blocks
\f[I]pbp\f[].
Using this function is faster than actually writing a block of zeros
since \f[B]libpmemblk\f[](7) uses metadata to indicate the block should
read back as zero.
.PP
The \f[B]pmemblk_set_error\f[]() function sets the error state for block
number \f[I]blockno\f[] in persistent memory resident array of blocks
\f[I]pbp\f[].
A block in the error state returns \f[I]errno\f[] \f[B]EIO\f[] when
read.
Writing the block clears the error state and returns the block to normal
use.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
On success, \f[B]pmemblk_set_zero\f[]() and \f[B]pmemblk_set_error\f[]()
return 0.
On error, they return \-1 and set \f[I]errno\f[] appropriately.
