.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]pmemobj_ctl_get\f[](), \f[B]pmemobj_ctl_set\f[]() and
\f[B]pmemobj_ctl_exec\f[]() functions provide a uniform interface for
querying and modifying the internal behavior of \f[B]libpmemobj\f[](7)
through the control (CTL) namespace.
.PP
The \f[I]name\f[] argument specifies an entry point as defined in the
CTL namespace specification.
The entry point description specifies whether the extra \f[I]arg\f[] is
required.
Those two parameters together create a CTL query.
The functions and the entry points are thread\-safe unless indicated
otherwise below.
If there are special conditions for calling an entry point, they are
explicitly stated in its description.
The functions propagate the return value of the entry point.
If either \f[I]name\f[] or \f[I]arg\f[] is invalid, \-1 is returned.
.PP
If the provided ctl query is valid, the CTL functions will always return
0 on success and \-1 on failure, unless otherwise specified in the entry
point description.
.PP
See more in \f[B]pmem_ctl\f[](5) man page.
.SH CTL NAMESPACE
.PP
prefault.at_create | rw | global | int | int | \- | boolean
.PP
If set, every page of the pool will be touched and written to when the
pool is created, in order to trigger page allocation and minimize the
performance impact of pagefaults.
Affects only the \f[B]pmemobj_create\f[]() function.
.PP
prefault.at_open | rw | global | int | int | \- | boolean
.PP
If set, every page of the pool will be touched and written to when the
pool is opened, in order to trigger page allocation and minimize the
performance impact of pagefaults.
Affects only the \f[B]pmemobj_open\f[]() function.
.PP
sds.at_create | rw | global | int | int | \- | boolean
.PP
If set, force\-enables or force\-disables SDS feature during pool
creation.
Affects only the \f[B]pmemobj_create\f[]() function.
See \f[B]pmempool_feature_query\f[](3) for information about SDS
(SHUTDOWN_STATE) feature.
.PP
copy_on_write.at_open | rw | global | int | int | \- | boolean
.PP
If set, pool is mapped in such a way that modifications don't reach the
underlying medium.
From the user's perspective this means that when the pool is closed all
changes are reverted.
This feature is not supported for pools located on Device DAX.
.PP
tx.debug.skip_expensive_checks | rw | \- | int | int | \- | boolean
.PP
Turns off some expensive checks performed by the transaction module in
\[lq]debug\[rq] builds.
Ignored in \[lq]release\[rq] builds.
.PP
tx.debug.verify_user_buffers | rw | \- | int | int | \- | boolean
.PP
Enables verification of user buffers provided by
\f[B]pmemobj_tx_log_append_buffer\f[](3) API.
For now the only verified aspect is whether the same buffer is used
simultaneously in 2 or more transactions or more than once in the same
transaction.
This value should not be modified at runtime if any transaction for the
current pool is in progress.
.PP
tx.cache.size | rw | \- | long long | long long | \- | integer
.PP
Size in bytes of the transaction snapshot cache.
In a larger cache the frequency of persistent allocations is lower, but
with higher fixed cost.
.PP
This should be set to roughly the sum of sizes of the snapshotted
regions in an average transaction in the pool.
.PP
This entry point is not thread safe and should not be modified if there
are any transactions currently running.
.PP
This value must be a in a range between 0 and
\f[B]PMEMOBJ_MAX_ALLOC_SIZE\f[], otherwise this entry point will fail.
.PP
tx.cache.threshold | rw | \- | long long | long long | \- | integer
.PP
This entry point is deprecated.
All snapshots, regardless of the size, use the transactional cache.
.PP
tx.post_commit.queue_depth | rw | \- | int | int | \- | integer
.PP
This entry point is deprecated.
.PP
tx.post_commit.worker | r\- | \- | void * | \- | \- | \-
.PP
This entry point is deprecated.
.PP
tx.post_commit.stop | r\- | \- | void * | \- | \- | \-
.PP
This entry point is deprecated.
.PP
heap.narenas.automatic | r\- | \- | unsigned | \- | \- | \-
.PP
Reads the number of arenas used in automatic scheduling of memory
operations for threads.
By default, this value is equal to the number of available processors.
An arena is a memory management structure which enables concurrency by
taking exclusive ownership of parts of the heap and allowing associated
threads to allocate without contention.
.PP
heap.narenas.total | r\- | \- | unsigned | \- | \- | \-
.PP
Reads the number of all created arenas.
It includes automatic arenas created by default and arenas created using
heap.arena.create CTL.
.PP
heap.narenas.max | rw\- | \- | unsigned | unsigned | \- | \-
.PP
Reads or writes the maximum number of arenas that can be created.
This entry point is not thread\-safe with regards to heap operations
(allocations, frees, reallocs).
.PP
heap.arena.[arena_id].size | r\- | \- | uint64_t | \- | \- | \-
.PP
Reads the total amount of memory in bytes which is currently exclusively
owned by the arena.
Large differences in this value between arenas might indicate an uneven
scheduling of memory resources.
The arena id cannot be 0.
.PP
heap.thread.arena_id | rw\- | \- | unsigned | unsigned | \- | \-
.PP
Reads the index of the arena assigned to the current thread or assigns
arena with specific id to the current thread.
The arena id cannot be 0.
.PP
heap.arena.create | \[en]x | \- | \- | \- | unsigned | \-
.PP
Creates and initializes one new arena in the heap.
This entry point reads an id of the new created arena.
.PP
Newly created arenas by this CTL are inactive, which means that the
arena will not be used in the automatic scheduling of memory requests.
To activate the new arena, use heap.arena.[arena_id].automatic CTL.
.PP
Arena created using this CTL can be used for allocation by explicitly
specifying the \f[I]arena_id\f[] for \f[B]POBJ_ARENA_ID(id)\f[] flag in
\f[B]pmemobj_tx_xalloc\f[]()/\f[B]pmemobj_xalloc\f[]()/\f[B]pmemobj_xreserve()\f[]
functions.
.PP
By default, the number of arenas is limited to 1024.
.PP
heap.arena.[arena_id].automatic | rw\- | \- | boolean | boolean | \- |
\-
.PP
Reads or modifies the state of the arena.
If set, the arena is used in automatic scheduling of memory operations
for threads.
This should be set to false if the application wants to manually manage
allocator scalability through explicitly assigning arenas to threads by
using heap.thread.arena_id.
The arena id cannot be 0 and at least one automatic arena must exist.
.PP
heap.alloc_class.[class_id].desc | rw | \- |
\f[C]struct\ pobj_alloc_class_desc\f[] |
\f[C]struct\ pobj_alloc_class_desc\f[] | \- | integer, integer, integer,
string
.PP
Describes an allocation class.
Allows one to create or view the internal data structures of the
allocator.
.PP
Creating custom allocation classes can be beneficial for both raw
allocation throughput, scalability and, most importantly, fragmentation.
By carefully constructing allocation classes that match the application
workload, one can entirely eliminate external and internal
fragmentation.
For example, it is possible to easily construct a slab\-like allocation
mechanism for any data structure.
.PP
The \f[C][class_id]\f[] is an index field.
Only values between 0\-254 are valid.
If setting an allocation class, but the \f[C]class_id\f[] is already
taken, the function will return \-1.
The values between 0\-127 are reserved for the default allocation
classes of the library and can be used only for reading.
.PP
The recommended method for retrieving information about all allocation
classes is to call this entry point for all class ids between 0 and 254
and discard those results for which the function returns an error.
.PP
This entry point takes a complex argument.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
struct\ pobj_alloc_class_desc\ {
\ \ \ \ size_t\ unit_size;
\ \ \ \ size_t\ alignment;
\ \ \ \ unsigned\ units_per_block;
\ \ \ \ enum\ pobj_header_type\ header_type;
\ \ \ \ unsigned\ class_id;
};
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The first field, \f[C]unit_size\f[], is an 8\-byte unsigned integer that
defines the allocation class size.
While theoretically limited only by \f[B]PMEMOBJ_MAX_ALLOC_SIZE\f[], for
most workloads this value should be between 8 bytes and 2 megabytes.
.PP
The \f[C]alignment\f[] field specifies the user data alignment of
objects allocated using the class.
If set, must be a power of two and an even divisor of unit size.
Alignment is limited to maximum of 2 megabytes.
All objects have default alignment of 64 bytes, but the user data
alignment is affected by the size of the chosen header.
.PP
The \f[C]units_per_block\f[] field defines how many units a single block
of memory contains.
This value will be adjusted to match the internal size of the block (256
kilobytes or a multiple thereof).
For example, given a class with a \f[C]unit_size\f[] of 512 bytes and a
\f[C]units_per_block\f[] of 1000, a single block of memory for that
class will have 512 kilobytes.
This is relevant because the bigger the block size, the less frequently
blocks need to be fetched, resulting in lower contention on global heap
state.
If the CTL call is being done at runtime, the \f[C]units_per_block\f[]
variable of the provided alloc class structure is modified to match the
actual value.
.PP
The \f[C]header_type\f[] field defines the header of objects from the
allocation class.
There are three types:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]POBJ_HEADER_LEGACY\f[], string value: \f[C]legacy\f[].
Used for allocation classes prior to version 1.3 of the library.
Not recommended for use.
Incurs a 64 byte metadata overhead for every object.
Fully supports all features.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]POBJ_HEADER_COMPACT\f[], string value: \f[C]compact\f[].
Used as default for all predefined allocation classes.
Incurs a 16 byte metadata overhead for every object.
Fully supports all features.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]POBJ_HEADER_NONE\f[], string value: \f[C]none\f[].
Header type that incurs no metadata overhead beyond a single bitmap
entry.
Can be used for very small allocation classes or when objects must be
adjacent to each other.
This header type does not support type numbers (type number is always
.RS 2
.IP "0)" 3
or allocations that span more than one unit.
.RE
.PP
The \f[C]class_id\f[] field is an optional, runtime\-only variable that
allows the user to retrieve the identifier of the class.
This will be equivalent to the provided \f[C][class_id]\f[].
This field cannot be set from a config file.
.PP
The allocation classes are a runtime state of the library and must be
created after every open.
It is highly recommended to use the configuration file to store the
classes.
.PP
This structure is declared in the \f[C]libpmemobj/ctl.h\f[] header file.
Please refer to this file for an in\-depth explanation of the allocation
classes and relevant algorithms.
.PP
Allocation classes constructed in this way can be leveraged by
explicitly specifying the class using \f[B]POBJ_CLASS_ID(id)\f[] flag in
\f[B]pmemobj_tx_xalloc\f[]()/\f[B]pmemobj_xalloc\f[]() functions.
.PP
Example of a valid alloc class query string:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
heap.alloc_class.128.desc=500,0,1000,compact
\f[]
.fi
.PP
This query, if executed, will create an allocation class with an id of
128 that has a unit size of 500 bytes, has at least 1000 units per block
and uses a compact header.
.PP
For reading, function returns 0 if successful, if the allocation class
does not exist it sets the errno to \f[B]ENOENT\f[] and returns \-1;
.PP
This entry point can fail if any of the parameters of the allocation
class is invalid or if exactly the same class already exists.
.PP
heap.alloc_class.new.desc | \-w | \- | \- |
\f[C]struct\ pobj_alloc_class_desc\f[] | \- | integer, integer, integer,
string
.PP
Same as \f[C]heap.alloc_class.[class_id].desc\f[], but instead of
requiring the user to provide the class_id, it automatically creates the
allocation class with the first available identifier.
.PP
This should be used when it's impossible to guarantee unique allocation
class naming in the application (e.g.\ when writing a library that uses
libpmemobj).
.PP
The required class identifier will be stored in the \f[C]class_id\f[]
field of the \f[C]struct\ pobj_alloc_class_desc\f[].
.PP
stats.enabled | rw | \- | enum pobj_stats_enabled | enum
pobj_stats_enabled | \- | string
.PP
Enables or disables runtime collection of statistics.
There are two types of statistics: persistent and transient ones.
Persistent statistics survive pool restarts, whereas transient ones
don't.
Statistics are not recalculated after enabling; any operations that
occur between disabling and re\-enabling will not be reflected in
subsequent values.
.PP
Only transient statistics are enabled by default.
Enabling persistent statistics may have non\-trivial performance impact.
.PP
stats.heap.curr_allocated | r\- | \- | uint64_t | \- | \- | \-
.PP
Reads the number of bytes currently allocated in the heap.
If statistics were disabled at any time in the lifetime of the heap,
this value may be inaccurate.
.PP
This is a persistent statistic.
.PP
stats.heap.run_allocated | r\- | \- | uint64_t | \- | \- | \-
.PP
Reads the number of bytes currently allocated using run\-based
allocation classes, i.e., huge allocations are not accounted for in this
statistic.
This is useful for comparison against stats.heap.run_active to estimate
the ratio between active and allocated memory.
.PP
This is a transient statistic and is rebuilt every time the pool is
opened.
.PP
stats.heap.run_active | r\- | \- | uint64_t | \- | \- | \-
.PP
Reads the number of bytes currently occupied by all run memory blocks,
including both allocated and free space, i.e., this is all the all space
that's not occupied by huge allocations.
.PP
This value is a sum of all allocated and free run memory.
In systems where memory is efficiently used, \f[C]run_active\f[] should
closely track \f[C]run_allocated\f[], and the amount of active, but
free, memory should be minimal.
.PP
A large relative difference between active memory and allocated memory
is indicative of heap fragmentation.
This information can be used to make a decision to call
\f[B]pmemobj_defrag()\f[](3) if the fragmentation looks to be high.
.PP
However, for small heaps \f[C]run_active\f[] might be disproportionately
higher than \f[C]run_allocated\f[] because the allocator typically
activates a significantly larger amount of memory than is required to
satisfy a single request in the anticipation of future needs.
For example, the first allocation of 100 bytes in a heap will trigger
activation of 256 kilobytes of space.
.PP
This is a transient statistic and is rebuilt lazily every time the pool
is opened.
.PP
heap.size.granularity | rw\- | \- | uint64_t | uint64_t | \- | long long
.PP
Reads or modifies the granularity with which the heap grows when OOM.
Valid only if the poolset has been defined with directories.
.PP
A granularity of 0 specifies that the pool will not grow automatically.
.PP
This entry point can fail if the granularity value is non\-zero and
smaller than \f[I]PMEMOBJ_MIN_PART\f[].
.PP
heap.size.extend | \[en]x | \- | \- | \- | uint64_t | \-
.PP
Extends the heap by the given size.
Must be larger than \f[I]PMEMOBJ_MIN_PART\f[].
.PP
This entry point can fail if the pool does not support extend
functionality or if there's not enough space left on the device.
.PP
debug.heap.alloc_pattern | rw | \- | int | int | \- | \-
.PP
Single byte pattern that is used to fill new uninitialized memory
allocation.
If the value is negative, no pattern is written.
This is intended for debugging, and is disabled by default.
.SH CTL EXTERNAL CONFIGURATION
.PP
In addition to direct function call, each write entry point can also be
set using two alternative methods.
.PP
The first method is to load a configuration directly from the
\f[B]PMEMOBJ_CONF\f[] environment variable.
.PP
The second method of loading an external configuration is to set the
\f[B]PMEMOBJ_CONF_FILE\f[] environment variable to point to a file that
contains a sequence of ctl queries.
.PP
See more in \f[B]pmem_ctl\f[](5) man page.
