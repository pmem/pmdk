.PP
The \f[B]pmemblk_bsize\f[R]() function returns the block size of the
specified block memory pool, that is, the value which was passed as
\f[I]bsize\f[R] to \f[B]pmemblk_create\f[R]().
\f[I]pbp\f[R] must be a block memory pool handle as returned by
\f[B]pmemblk_open\f[R](3) or \f[B]pmemblk_create\f[R](3).
.PP
The \f[B]pmemblk_nblock\f[R]() function returns the usable space in the
block memory pool.
\f[I]pbp\f[R] must be a block memory pool handle as returned by
\f[B]pmemblk_open\f[R](3) or \f[B]pmemblk_create\f[R](3).
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
The \f[B]pmemblk_bsize\f[R]() function returns the block size of the
specified block memory pool.
.PP
The \f[B]pmemblk_nblock\f[R]() function returns the usable space in the
block memory pool, expressed as the number of blocks available.
