.nf
\f[C]
#include\ <libpmemblk.h>

size_t\ pmemblk_bsize(PMEMblkpool\ *pbp);
size_t\ pmemblk_nblock(PMEMblkpool\ *pbp);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]pmemblk_bsize\f[]() function returns the block size of the
specified block memory pool, that is, the value which was passed as
\f[I]bsize\f[] to \f[B]pmemblk_create\f[]().
\f[I]pbp\f[] must be a block memory pool handle as returned by
\f[B]pmemblk_open\f[](3) or \f[B]pmemblk_create\f[](3).
.PP
The \f[B]pmemblk_nblock\f[]() function returns the usable space in the
block memory pool.
\f[I]pbp\f[] must be a block memory pool handle as returned by
\f[B]pmemblk_open\f[](3) or \f[B]pmemblk_create\f[](3).
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
The \f[B]pmemblk_bsize\f[]() function returns the block size of the
specified block memory pool.
.PP
The \f[B]pmemblk_nblock\f[]() function returns the usable space in the
block memory pool, expressed as the number of blocks available.
