\f[B]pmem2_config_set_offset\f[]() \- set offset in the pmem2_config
structure
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#include\ <libpmem2.h>

struct\ pmem2_config;
int\ pmem2_config_set_offset(struct\ pmem2_config\ *config,\ size_t\ offset);
\f[]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]pmem2_config_set_offset\f[]() function configures the offset
which will be used to map the contents from the specified location of
the source.
\f[I]*config\f[] should be already initialized, please see
\f[B]pmem2_config_new\f[](3) for details.
The \f[I]must be a multiple of the alignment required for the config. To
retrieve the alignment required for specific \f[]*config* please use
\f[B]pmem2_config_get_alignment\f[](3).
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
The \f[B]pmem2_config_set_offset\f[]() function returns 0 on success.
Otherwise, it returns:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEM2_E_OFFSET_OUT_OF_RANGE\f[] \- argument out of range, offset is
greater than \f[B]INT64_MAX\f[]
