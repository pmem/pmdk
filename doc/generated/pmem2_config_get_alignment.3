.SH NAME
.PP
\f[B]pmem2_config_get_alignment\f[R]() \- query an alignment
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#include <libpmem2.h>

struct pmem2_config;
int pmem2_config_get_alignment(const struct pmem2_config *config, size_t *alignment);
\f[R]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]pmem2_config_get_alignment\f[R]() function retrieves the
alignment of offset and length needed for \f[B]pmem2_map\f[R](3) to
succeed.
The alignment is stored in \f[I]*alignment\f[R].
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
The \f[B]pmem2_config_get_alignment\f[R]() function returns 0 on
success.
If the function fails, the \f[I]*alignment\f[R] variable is left
unmodified, and one of the following errors is returned:
.PP
On all systems:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEM2_E_FILE_HANDLE_NOT_SET\f[R] \- config doesn\[cq]t contain the
file handle (see \f[B]pmem2_config_set_fd\f[R](3),
\f[B]pmem2_config_set_handle\f[R](3)).
.PP
on Linux and FreeBSD:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEM2_E_INVALID_FILE_HANDLE\f[R] \- config contains an invalid file
handle.
.PP
on Linux:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEM2_E_INVALID_FILE_TYPE\f[R] \- file descriptor points to a
directory, block device, pipe, or socket.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEM2_E_INVALID_FILE_TYPE\f[R] \- file descriptor points to a
character device other than Device DAX.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEM2_E_INVALID_ALIGNMENT_FORMAT\f[R] \- kernel query for Device
DAX alignment returned data in invalid format.
.IP \[bu] 2
\-\f[B]errno\f[R] set by failing \f[B]fstat\f[R](2), while trying to
validate the file descriptor.
.IP \[bu] 2
\-\f[B]errno\f[R] set by failing \f[B]realpath\f[R](3), while trying to
determine whether fd points to a Device DAX.
.IP \[bu] 2
\-\f[B]errno\f[R] set by failing \f[B]read\f[R](2), while trying to
determine Device DAX\[cq]s alignment.
.IP \[bu] 2
\-\f[B]errno\f[R] set by failing \f[B]strtoull\f[R](3), while trying to
determine Device DAX\[cq]s alignment.
.PP
On FreeBSD:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEM2_E_INVALID_FILE_TYPE\f[R] \- file descriptor points to a
directory, block device, pipe, socket, or character device.
.IP \[bu] 2
\-\f[B]errno\f[R] set by failing \f[B]fstat\f[R](2), while trying to
validate the file descriptor.
