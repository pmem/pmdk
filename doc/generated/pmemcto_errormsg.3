pmemcto_errormsg \-\- return string describing last error
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#include\ <libpmemcto.h>

const\ char\ *pmemcto_errormsg(void);
\f[]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]pmemcto_errormsg\f[]() function returns a pointer to a static
buffer containing the last error message logged for current thread.
The error message may include description of the corresponding error
code (if \f[I]errno\f[] was set), as returned by \f[B]strerror\f[](3).
The error message buffer is thread\-local; errors encountered in one
thread do not affect its value in other threads.
The buffer is never cleared by any library function; its content is
significant only when the return value of the immediately preceding call
to \f[B]libpmemcto\f[] function indicated an error, or if \f[I]errno\f[]
was set.
The application must not modify or free the error message string, but it
may be modified by subsequent calls to other library functions.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
The \f[B]pmemcto_errormsg\f[]() function returns a pointer to a string
that describes the last error encountered by \f[B]libpmemcto\f[] for
current thread.
.SH ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
.PP
\f[B]libpmemcto\f[] depends on jemalloc, written by Jason Evans, to do
the heavy lifting of managing dynamic memory allocation.
See: <http://www.canonware.com/jemalloc>
.PP
\f[B]libpmemcto\f[] builds on the persistent memory programming model
recommended by the SNIA NVM Programming Technical Work Group:
<http://snia.org/nvmp>
