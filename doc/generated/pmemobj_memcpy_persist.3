.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]libpmemobj\f[]\-specific low\-level memory manipulation
functions described here leverage the knowledge of the additional
configuration options available for \f[B]libpmemobj\f[](7) pools, such
as replication.
They also take advantage of the type of storage behind the pool and use
appropriate flush/drain functions.
It is advised to use these functions in conjunction with
\f[B]libpmemobj\f[](7) objects rather than using low\-level memory
manipulation functions from \f[B]libpmem\f[].
.PP
The \f[B]pmemobj_memcpy_persist\f[]() and
\f[B]pmemobj_memset_persist\f[]() functions provide the same memory
copying as their namesakes \f[B]memcpy\f[](3), and \f[B]memset\f[](3),
and ensure that the result has been flushed to persistence before
returning.
.PP
\f[B]pmemobj_persist\f[]() forces any changes in the range
[\f[I]addr\f[], \f[I]addr\f[]+\f[I]len\f[]) to be stored durably in
persistent memory.
Internally this may call either \f[B]pmem_msync\f[](3) or
\f[B]pmem_persist\f[](3).
There are no alignment restrictions on the range described by
\f[I]addr\f[] and \f[I]len\f[], but \f[B]pmemobj_persist\f[]() may
expand the range as necessary to meet platform alignment requirements.
.RS
.PP
WARNING: Like \f[B]msync\f[](2), there is nothing atomic or
transactional about this call.
Any unwritten stores in the given range will be written, but some stores
may have already been written by virtue of normal cache
eviction/replacement policies.
Correctly written code must not depend on stores waiting until
\f[B]pmemobj_persist\f[]() is called to become persistent \- they can
become persistent at any time before \f[B]pmemobj_persist\f[]() is
called.
.RE
.PP
The \f[B]pmemobj_flush\f[]() and \f[B]pmemobj_drain\f[]() functions
provide partial versions of the \f[B]pmemobj_persist\f[]() function
described above.
These functions allow advanced programs to create their own variations
of \f[B]pmemobj_persist\f[]().
For example, a program that needs to flush several discontiguous ranges
can call \f[B]pmemobj_flush\f[]() for each range and then follow up by
calling \f[B]pmemobj_drain\f[]() once.
For more information on partial flushing operations, see
\f[B]pmem_flush\f[](3).
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
The \f[B]pmemobj_memcpy_persist\f[]() and
\f[B]pmemobj_memset_persist\f[]() functions return the same values as
their namesakes \f[B]memcpy\f[](3), and \f[B]memset\f[](3).
.PP
\f[B]pmemobj_persist\f[](), \f[B]pmemobj_flush\f[]() and
\f[B]pmemobj_drain\f[]() return no value.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
The following code is functionally equivalent to
\f[B]pmemobj_memcpy_persist\f[]():
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
void\ *
pmemobj_memcpy_persist(PMEMobjpool\ *pop,\ void\ *dest,
\ \ \ \ const\ void\ *src,\ size_t\ len)
{
\ \ \ \ void\ *retval\ =\ memcpy(dest,\ src,\ len);

\ \ \ \ pmemobj_persist(pop,\ dest,\ len);

\ \ \ \ return\ retval;
}
\f[]
.fi
.PP
\f[B]pmemobj_persist\f[]() can be thought of as this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
void
pmemobj_persist(PMEMobjpool\ *pop,\ const\ void\ *addr,\ size_t\ len)
{
\ \ \ \ /*\ flush\ the\ processor\ caches\ */
\ \ \ \ pmemobj_flush(pop,\ addr,\ len);

\ \ \ \ /*\ wait\ for\ any\ pmem\ stores\ to\ drain\ from\ HW\ buffers\ */
\ \ \ \ pmemobj_drain(pop);
}
\f[]
