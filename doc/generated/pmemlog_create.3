.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]pmemlog_create\f[]() function creates a log memory pool with
the given total \f[I]poolsize\f[].
Since the transactional nature of a log memory pool requires some space
overhead in the memory pool, the resulting available log size is less
than \f[I]poolsize\f[], and is made available to the caller via the
\f[B]pmemlog_nbyte\f[](3) function.
\f[I]path\f[] specifies the name of the memory pool file to be created.
\f[I]mode\f[] specifies the permissions to use when creating the file as
described by \f[B]creat\f[](2).
The memory pool file is fully allocated to the size \f[I]poolsize\f[]
using \f[B]posix_fallocate\f[](3).
The caller may choose to take responsibility for creating the memory
pool file by creating it before calling \f[B]pmemlog_create\f[]() and
then specifying \f[I]poolsize\f[] as zero.
In this case \f[B]pmemlog_create\f[]() will take the pool size from the
size of the existing file and will verify that the file appears to be
empty by searching for any non\-zero data in the pool header at the
beginning of the file.
The net pool size of a pool file is equal to the file size.
The minimum net pool size allowed by the library for a log pool is
defined in \f[B]<libpmemlog.h>\f[] as \f[B]PMEMLOG_MIN_POOL\f[].
.PP
Depending on the configuration of the system, the available
non\-volatile memory space may be divided into multiple memory devices.
In such case, the maximum size of the pmemlog memory pool could be
limited by the capacity of a single memory device.
\f[B]libpmemlog\f[](7) allows building persistent memory resident logs
spanning multiple memory devices by creation of persistent memory pools
consisting of multiple files, where each part of such a \f[I]pool
set\f[] may be stored on a different memory device or pmem\-aware
filesystem.
.PP
Creation of all the parts of the pool set can be done with
\f[B]pmemlog_create\f[](); however, the recommended method for creating
pool sets is with the \f[B]pmempool\f[](1) utility.
.PP
When creating a pool set consisting of multiple files, the \f[I]path\f[]
argument passed to \f[B]pmemlog_create\f[]() must point to the special
\f[I]set\f[] file that defines the pool layout and the location of all
the parts of the pool set.
The \f[I]poolsize\f[] argument must be 0.
The meaning of the \f[I]mode\f[] argument does not change, except that
the same \f[I]mode\f[] is used for creation of all the parts of the pool
set.
.PP
The set file is a plain text file, the structure of which is described
in \f[B]poolset\f[](5).
.PP
The \f[B]pmemlog_open\f[]() function opens an existing log memory pool.
Similar to \f[B]pmemlog_create\f[](), \f[I]path\f[] must identify either
an existing log memory pool file, or the \f[I]set\f[] file used to
create a pool set.
The application must have permission to open the file and memory map the
file or pool set with read/write permissions.
.PP
Be aware that if the pool contains bad blocks inside, opening can be
aborted by the SIGBUS signal, because currently the pool is not checked
against bad blocks during opening.
It can be turned on by setting the CHECK_BAD_BLOCKS compat feature.
For details see description of this feature in
\f[B]pmempool\-feature\f[](1).
.PP
The \f[B]pmemlog_close\f[]() function closes the memory pool indicated
by \f[I]plp\f[] and deletes the memory pool handle.
The log memory pool itself lives on in the file that contains it and may
be re\-opened at a later time using \f[B]pmemlog_open\f[]() as described
above.
.PP
The \f[B]pmemlog_check\f[]() function performs a consistency check of
the file indicated by \f[I]path\f[].
\f[B]pmemlog_check\f[]() opens the given \f[I]path\f[] read\-only so it
never makes any changes to the file.
This function is not supported on Device DAX.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
On success, \f[B]pmemlog_create\f[]() returns a \f[I]PMEMlogpool*\f[]
handle to the memory pool that is used with most of the functions from
\f[B]libpmemlog\f[](7).
If an error prevents any of the pool set files from being created, it
returns NULL and sets \f[I]errno\f[] appropriately.
.PP
On success, \f[B]pmemlog_open\f[]() returns a \f[I]PMEMlogpool*\f[]
handle to the memory pool that is used with most of the functions from
\f[B]libpmemlog\f[](7).
If an error prevents the pool from being opened, or a pool set is being
opened and the actual size of any file does not match the corresponding
part size defined in the \f[I]set\f[] file, \f[B]pmemlog_open\f[]()
returns NULL and sets \f[I]errno\f[] appropriately.
.PP
The \f[B]pmemlog_close\f[]() function returns no value.
.PP
The \f[B]pmemlog_check\f[]() function returns 1 if the persistent memory
resident log file is found to be consistent.
Any inconsistencies will cause \f[B]pmemlog_check\f[]() to return 0, in
which case the use of the file with \f[B]libpmemlog\f[] will result in
undefined behavior.
The debug version of \f[B]libpmemlog\f[] will provide additional details
on inconsistencies when \f[B]PMEMLOG_LOG_LEVEL\f[] is at least 1, as
described in the \f[B]DEBUGGING AND ERROR HANDLING\f[] section in
\f[B]libpmemlog\f[](7).
\f[B]pmemlog_check\f[]() will return \-1 and set \f[I]errno\f[] if it
cannot perform the consistency check due to other errors.
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
Not all file systems support \f[B]posix_fallocate\f[](3).
\f[B]pmemlog_create\f[]() will fail if the underlying file system does
not support \f[B]posix_fallocate\f[](3).
