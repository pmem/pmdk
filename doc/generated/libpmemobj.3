.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]libpmemobj\f[] provides a transactional object store in
\f[I]persistent memory\f[] (pmem).
This library is intended for applications using direct access storage
(DAX), which is storage that supports load/store access without paging
blocks from a block storage device.
Some types of \f[I]non\-volatile memory DIMMs\f[] (NVDIMMs) provide this
type of byte addressable access to storage.
A \f[I]persistent memory aware file system\f[] is typically used to
expose the direct access to applications.
Memory mapping a file from this type of file system results in the
load/store, non\-paged access to pmem.
\f[B]libpmemobj\f[] builds on this type of memory mapped file.
.PP
This library is for applications that need a transactions and persistent
memory management.
The \f[B]libpmemobj\f[] requires a \f[B]\-std=gnu99\f[] compilation flag
to build properly.
This library builds on the low\-level pmem support provided by
\f[B]libpmem\f[], handling the transactional updates, flushing changes
to persistence, and recovery for the application.
.PP
\f[B]libpmemobj\f[] is one of a collection of persistent memory
libraries available, the others are:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]libpmemblk\f[](3), providing pmem\-resident arrays of fixed\-sized
blocks with atomic updates.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]libpmemlog\f[](3), providing a pmem\-resident log file.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]libpmem\f[](3), low\-level persistent memory support.
.PP
Under normal usage, \f[B]libpmemobj\f[] will never print messages or
intentionally cause the process to exit.
The only exception to this is the debugging information, when enabled,
as described under \f[B]DEBUGGING AND ERROR HANDLING\f[] below.
.SH MOST COMMONLY USED FUNCTIONS
.PP
To use the pmem\-resident transactional object store provided by
\f[B]libpmemobj\f[], a \f[I]memory pool\f[] is first created.
This is done with the \f[B]pmemobj_create\f[]() function described in
this section.
The other functions described in this section then operate on the
resulting memory pool.
.PP
Once created, the memory pool is represented by an opaque handle, of
type \f[I]PMEMobjpool*\f[], which is passed to most of the other
functions in this section.
Internally, \f[B]libpmemobj\f[] will use either \f[B]pmem_persist\f[]()
or \f[B]msync\f[](2) when it needs to flush changes, depending on
whether the memory pool appears to be persistent memory or a regular
file (see the \f[B]pmem_is_pmem\f[]() function in \f[B]libpmem\f[](3)
for more information).
There is no need for applications to flush changes directly when using
the obj memory API provided by \f[B]libpmemobj\f[].
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
PMEMobjpool\ *pmemobj_open(const\ char\ *path,\ const\ char\ *layout);
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The \f[B]pmemobj_open\f[]() function opens an existing object store
memory pool, returning a memory pool handle used with most of the
functions in this section.
\f[I]path\f[] must be an existing file containing a pmemobj memory pool
as created by \f[B]pmemobj_create\f[]().
If \f[I]layout\f[] is non\-NULL, it is compared to the layout name
provided to \f[B]pmemobj_create\f[]() when the pool was first created.
This can be used to verify the layout of the pool matches what was
expected.
The application must have permission to open the file and memory map it
with read/write permissions.
If an error prevents the pool from being opened, or if the given
\f[I]layout\f[] does not match the pool\[aq]s layout,
\f[B]pmemobj_open\f[]() returns NULL and sets \f[I]errno\f[]
appropriately.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
PMEMobjpool\ *pmemobj_create(const\ char\ *path,\ const\ char\ *layout,
\ \ \ \ size_t\ poolsize,\ mode_t\ mode);
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The \f[B]pmemobj_create\f[]() function creates a transactional object
store with the given total \f[I]poolsize\f[].
\f[I]path\f[] specifies the name of the memory pool file to be created.
\f[I]layout\f[] specifies the application\[aq]s layout type in the form
of a string.
The layout name is not interpreted by \f[B]libpmemobj\f[], but may be
used as a check when \f[B]pmemobj_open\f[]() is called.
The layout name, including the terminating null byte (\[aq]\[aq]),
cannot be longer than \f[B]PMEMOBJ_MAX_LAYOUT\f[] as defined in
\f[B]<libpmemobj.h>\f[].
It is allowed to pass NULL as \f[I]layout\f[], which is equivalent for
using an empty string as a layout name.
\f[I]mode\f[] specifies the permissions to use when creating the file as
described by \f[B]creat\f[](2).
The memory pool file is fully allocated to the size \f[I]poolsize\f[]
using \f[B]posix_fallocate\f[](3).
The caller may choose to take responsibility for creating the memory
pool file by creating it before calling \f[B]pmemobj_create\f[]() and
then specifying \f[I]poolsize\f[] as zero.
In this case \f[B]pmemobj_create\f[]() will take the pool size from the
size of the existing file and will verify that the file appears to be
empty by searching for any non\-zero data in the pool header at the
beginning of the file.
The minimum file size allowed by the library for a local transactional
object store is defined in \f[B]<libpmemobj.h>\f[] as
\f[B]PMEMOBJ_MIN_POOL\f[].
For remote replicas the minimum file size is defined in
\f[B]<librpmem.h>\f[] as \f[B]RPMEM_MIN_PART\f[].
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
void\ pmemobj_close(PMEMobjpool\ *pop);
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The \f[B]pmemobj_close\f[]() function closes the memory pool indicated
by \f[I]pop\f[] and deletes the memory pool handle.
The object store itself lives on in the file that contains it and may be
re\-opened at a later time using \f[B]pmemobj_open\f[]() as described
above.
.SH LOW\-LEVEL MEMORY MANIPULATION
.PP
The \f[B]libpmemobj\f[] specific low\-level memory manipulation
functions leverage the knowledge of the additional configuration options
available for \f[B]libpmemobj\f[] pools, such as replication.
They also take advantage of the type of storage behind the pool and use
appropriate flush/drain functions.
It is advised to use these functions in conjunction with
\f[B]libpmemobj\f[] objects, instead of using low\-level memory
manipulations functions from \f[B]libpmem\f[].

.SH POOL SETS AND REPLICAS
.PP
Depending on the configuration of the system, the available space of
non\-volatile memory space may be divided into multiple memory devices.
In such case, the maximum size of the transactional object store could
be limited by the capacity of a single memory device.
The \f[B]libpmemobj\f[] allows building transactional object stores
spanning multiple memory devices by creation of persistent memory pools
consisting of multiple files, where each part of such a \f[I]pool
set\f[] may be stored on different pmem\-aware filesystem.
.PP
To improve reliability and eliminate the single point of failure, all
the changes of the data stored in the persistent memory pool could be
also automatically written to local or remote pool replicas, thereby
providing a backup for a persistent memory pool by producing a
\f[I]mirrored pool set\f[].
In practice, the pool replicas may be considered as binary copies of the
"master" pool set.
.PP
Creation of all the parts of the pool set and the associated replica
sets can be done with the \f[B]pmemobj_create\f[]() function or by using
the \f[B]pmempool\f[](1) utility.
.PP
Restoring data from a local or remote replica can be done by using the
\f[B]pmempool\-sync\f[](1) command or \f[B]pmempool_sync\f[]() API from
the \f[B]libpmempool\f[](3) library.
.PP
Modifications of a pool set file configuration can be done by using the
\f[B]pmempool\-transform\f[](1) command or \f[B]pmempool_transform\f[]()
API from the \f[B]libpmempool\f[](3) library.
.PP
When creating the pool set consisting of multiple files, or when
creating the replicated pool set, the \f[I]path\f[] argument passed to
\f[B]pmemobj_create\f[]() must point to the special \f[I]set\f[] file
that defines the pool layout and the location of all the parts of the
pool set.
The \f[I]poolsize\f[] argument must be 0.
The meaning of \f[I]layout\f[] and \f[I]mode\f[] arguments doesn\[aq]t
change, except that the same \f[I]mode\f[] is used for creation of all
the parts of the pool set and replicas.
If the error prevents any of the pool set files from being created,
\f[B]pmemobj_create\f[]() returns NULL and sets \f[I]errno\f[]
appropriately.
.PP
When opening the pool set consisting of multiple files, or when opening
the replicated pool set, the \f[I]path\f[] argument passed to
\f[B]pmemobj_open\f[]() must not point to the pmemobj memory pool file,
but to the same \f[I]set\f[] file that was used for the pool set
creation.
If an error prevents any of the pool set files from being opened, or if
the actual size of any file does not match the corresponding part size
defined in \f[I]set\f[] file \f[B]pmemobj_open\f[]() returns NULL and
sets \f[I]errno\f[] appropriately.
.PP
The set file is a plain text file, which must start with the line
containing a \f[I]PMEMPOOLSET\f[] string, followed by the specification
of all the pool parts in the next lines.
For each part, the file size and the absolute path must be provided.
The size has to be compliant with the format specified in IEC 80000\-13,
IEEE 1541 or the Metric Interchange Format.
Standards accept SI units with obligatory B \- kB, MB, GB, ...
(multiplier by 1000) and IEC units with optional "iB" \- KiB, MiB, GiB,
..., K, M, G, ...
\- (multiplier by 1024).
The minimum file size of each part of the pool set is the same as the
minimum size allowed for a transactional object store consisting of one
file.
It is defined in \f[B]<libpmemobj.h>\f[] as \f[B]PMEMOBJ_MIN_POOL\f[].
.PP
Sections defining the replica sets are optional.
There could be multiple replica sections and each must start with the
line containing a \f[I]REPLICA\f[] string.
Lines starting with "#" character are ignored.
A replica can be local or remote.
In case of a local replica, the REPLICA line has to consist of the
\f[I]REPLICA\f[] string only and it has to be followed by at least one
line defining a part of the local replica.
The format of such line is the same as the format of the line defining a
part of the PMEMOBJ pool as described above.
.PP
The path of a part can point to a Device DAX and in such case the size
argument can be set to an "AUTO" string, which means that the size of
the device will be automatically resolved at pool creation time.
When using Device DAX there\[aq]s also one additional restriction \- it
is not allowed to concatenate more than one Device DAX device in a
single replica if the configured internal alignment is other than 4KiB.
In such case given replica can consist only of a single part (single
Device DAX).
Please see \f[B]ndctl\-create\-namespace\f[](1) for information on how
to configure desired alignment on Device DAX.
.PP
Device DAX is the device\-centric analogue of Filesystem DAX.
It allows memory ranges to be allocated and mapped without need of an
intervening file system.
For more information please see \f[B]ndctl\-create\-namespace\f[](1).
.PP
In case of a remote replica, the \f[I]REPLICA\f[] keyword has to be
followed by an address of a remote host (in the format recognized by the
\f[B]ssh\f[](1) remote login client) and a relative path to a remote
pool set file (located in the root config directory on the target node
\- see \f[B]librpmem\f[](3)):

.SH LOCKING
.PP
\f[B]libpmemobj\f[] provides several types of synchronization
primitives, designed so as to use them with persistent memory.
The locks are not dynamically allocated, but embedded in pmem\-resident
objects.
For performance reasons, they are also padded up to 64 bytes (cache line
size).
.PP
Pmem\-aware locks implementation is based on the standard POSIX Thread
Library, as described in \f[B]pthread_mutex\f[](3),
\f[B]pthread_rwlock\f[](3) and \f[B]pthread_cond\f[](3).
They provide semantics similar to standard \f[B]pthread\f[] locks,
except that they are considered initialized by zeroing them.
So allocating the locks with \f[B]pmemobj_zalloc\f[]() or
\f[B]pmemobj_tx_zalloc\f[]() does not require another initialization
step.
.PP
The fundamental property of pmem\-aware locks is their automatic
reinitialization every time the persistent object store pool is open.
This way, all the pmem\-aware locks may be considered initialized
(unlocked) right after opening the pool, regardless of their state at
the time the pool was closed for the last time.
.PP
Pmem\-aware mutexes, read/write locks and condition variables must be
declared with one of the \f[I]PMEMmutex\f[], \f[I]PMEMrwlock\f[], or
\f[I]PMEMcond\f[] type respectively.

.SH PERSISTENT OBJECTS
.PP
Each object stored in persistent memory pool is represented by an object
handle of type \f[I]PMEMoid\f[].
In practice, such a handle is a unique Object IDentifier (\f[I]OID\f[])
of a global scope, which means that two objects from different pools may
not have the same \f[I]OID\f[].
The special \f[B]OID_NULL\f[] macro defines a NULL\-like handle that
does not represent any object.
The size of a single object is limited by a
\f[B]PMEMOBJ_MAX_ALLOC_SIZE\f[].
Thus an allocation with requested size greater than this value will
fail.
.PP
An \f[I]OID\f[] cannot be considered as a direct pointer to an object.
Each time the program attempts to read or write object data, it must
obtain the current memory address of the object by converting its
\f[I]OID\f[] into the pointer.
.PP
In contrast to the memory address, the \f[I]OID\f[] value for given
object does not change during the life of an object (except for realloc
operation), and remains valid after closing and reopening the pool.
For this reason, if an object contains a reference to another persistent
object \- necessary to build some kind of a linked data structure \- it
shall never use memory address of an object, but its \f[I]OID\f[].

POBJ_FOREACH_SAFE_TYPE(PMEMobjpool\ *pop,\ TOID\ var,\ TOID\ nvar)
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The macros \f[B]POBJ_FOREACH_SAFE\f[]() and
\f[B]POBJ_FOREACH_SAFE_TYPE\f[]() work in a similar fashion as
\f[B]POBJ_FOREACH\f[]() and \f[B]POBJ_FOREACH_TYPE\f[]() except that
prior to performing the operation on the object, they preserve a handle
to the next object in the collection by assigning it to \f[I]nvaroid\f[]
or \f[I]nvar\f[] variable.
This allows safe deletion of selected objects while iterating through
the collection.
.SH ROOT OBJECT MANAGEMENT
.PP
The root object of persistent memory pool is an entry point for all
other persistent objects allocated using the \f[B]libpmemobj\f[] API.
In other words, every single object stored in persistent memory pool
should have the root object at the end of its reference path.
It may be assumed that for each persistent memory pool the root object
always exists, and there is exactly one root object in each pool.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
PMEMoid\ pmemobj_root(PMEMobjpool\ *pop,\ size_t\ size);
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The \f[B]pmemobj_root\f[]() function returns a handle to the root object
associated with the persistent memory pool pointed by \f[I]pop\f[].
If this is the first call to \f[B]pmemobj_root\f[]() and the root object
does not exists yet, it is implicitly allocated in a thread\-safe
manner, so if the function is called by more than one thread
simultaneously (with identical \f[I]size\f[] value), the same root
object handle is returned in all the threads.
.PP
The size of the root object is guaranteed to be not less than the
requested \f[I]size\f[].
If the requested size is larger than the current size, the root object
is automatically resized.
In such case, the old data is preserved and the extra space is zeroed.
The \f[B]pmemobj_root\f[]() function shall not fail, except for the case
if the requested object size is larger than the maximum allocation size
supported for given pool, or if there is not enough free space in the
pool to satisfy the reallocation of the root object.
In such case, \f[B]OID_NULL\f[] is returned.
.IP

PMEMoid\ pmemobj_root_construct(PMEMobjpool\ *pop,\ size_t\ size,
\ \ \ \ pmemobj_constr\ constructor,\ void\ *arg)

.PP
The \f[B]pmemobj_root_construct\f[]() performs the same actions as the
\f[B]pmemobj_root\f[]() function, but instead of zeroing the newly
allocated object a \f[I]constructor\f[] function is called.
The constructor is also called on reallocations.
If the constructor returns non\-zero value the allocation is canceled,
the \f[I]OID_NULL\f[] value is returned from the caller and
\f[I]errno\f[] is set to \f[B]ECANCELED\f[].
The \f[B]pmemobj_root_size\f[]() can be used in the constructor to check
whether it\[aq]s the first call to the constructor.

.IP
.nf
\f[C]
size_t\ pmemobj_root_size(PMEMobjpool\ *pop);
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The \f[B]pmemobj_root_size\f[]() function returns the current size of
the root object associated with the persistent memory pool pointed by
\f[I]pop\f[].
The returned size is the largest value requested by any of the earlier
\f[B]pmemobj_root\f[]() calls.
0 is returned if the root object has not been allocated yet.
.SH NON\-TRANSACTIONAL ATOMIC ALLOCATIONS
.PP
Functions described in this section provide the mechanism to allocate,
resize and free objects from the persistent memory pool in a
thread\-safe and fail\-safe manner.
All the routines are atomic with respect to other threads and any
power\-fail interruptions.
If any of those operations is torn by program failure or system crash;
on recovery they are guaranteed to be entirely completed or discarded,
leaving the persistent memory heap and internal object containers in a
consistent state.
.PP
All these functions can be used outside transactions.
Note that operations performed using non\-transactional API are
considered durable after completion, even if executed within the open
transaction.
Such non\-transactional changes will not be rolled\-back if the
transaction is aborted or interrupted.
.PP
The allocations are always aligned to the cache\-line boundary.

The \f[I]pmemobj_constr\f[] type represents a constructor for atomic
allocation from persistent memory heap associated with memory pool

.PP
The \f[B]pmemobj_alloc\f[]() function allocates a new object from the
persistent memory heap associated with memory pool \f[I]pop\f[].
The \f[I]PMEMoid\f[] of allocated object is stored in \f[I]oidp\f[].
If NULL is passed as \f[I]oidp\f[], then the newly allocated object may
be accessed only by iterating objects in the object container associated
with given \f[I]type_num\f[], as described in \f[B]OBJECT CONTAINERS\f[]
section.
If the \f[I]oidp\f[] points to memory location from the \f[B]pmemobj\f[]
heap the \f[I]oidp\f[] is modified atomically.
Before returning, it calls the \f[I]constructor\f[] function passing the
pool handle \f[I]pop\f[], the pointer to the newly allocated object in
\f[I]ptr\f[] along with the \f[I]arg\f[] argument.
It is guaranteed that allocated object is either properly initialized,
or if the allocation is interrupted before the constructor completes,
the memory space reserved for the object is reclaimed.
If the constructor returns non\-zero value the allocation is canceled,
the \-1 value is returned from the caller and \f[I]errno\f[] is set to
\f[B]ECANCELED\f[].
The \f[I]size\f[] can be any non\-zero value, however due to internal
padding and object metadata, the actual size of the allocation will
differ from the requested one by at least 64 bytes.
For this reason, making the allocations of a size less than 64 bytes is
extremely inefficient and discouraged.
If \f[I]size\f[] equals 0, then \f[B]pmemobj_alloc\f[]() returns
non\-zero value, sets the \f[I]errno\f[] and leaves the \f[I]oidp\f[]
untouched.

.SH NON\-TRANSACTIONAL PERSISTENT ATOMIC LISTS
.PP
Besides the internal objects collections described in section
\f[B]OBJECT CONTAINERS\f[] the \f[B]libpmemobj\f[] provides a mechanism
to organize persistent objects in the user\-defined persistent atomic
circular doubly linked lists.
All the routines and macros operating on the persistent lists provide
atomicity with respect to any power\-fail interruptions.
If any of those operations is torn by program failure or system crash;
on recovery they are guaranteed to be entirely completed or discarded,
leaving the lists, persistent memory heap and internal object containers
in a consistent state.
.PP
The persistent atomic circular doubly linked lists support the following
functionality:
.IP \[bu] 2
Insertion of an object at the head of the list, or at the end of the
list.
.IP \[bu] 2
Insertion of an object before or after any element in the list.
.IP \[bu] 2
Atomic allocation and insertion of a new object at the head of the list,
or at the end of the list.
.IP \[bu] 2
Atomic allocation and insertion of a new object before or after any
element in the list.
.IP \[bu] 2
Atomic moving of an element from one list to the specific location on
another list.
.IP \[bu] 2
Removal of any object in the list.
.IP \[bu] 2
Atomic removal and freeing of any object in the list.
.IP \[bu] 2
Forward or backward traversal through the list.
.PP
A list is headed by a \f[I]list_head\f[] structure containing a single
object handle of the first element on the list.
The elements are doubly linked so that an arbitrary element can be
removed without a need to traverse the list.
New elements can be added to the list before or after an existing
element, at the head of the list, or at the end of the list.
A list may be traversed in either direction.
.PP
The user\-defined structure of each element must contain a field of type
\f[I]list_entry\f[] holding the object handles to the previous and next
element on the list.
Both the \f[I]list_head\f[] and the \f[I]list_entry\f[] structures are
declared in \f[B]<libpmemobj.h>\f[].
.PP
The functions below are intended to be used outside transactions \-
transactional variants are described in section \f[B]TRANSACTIONAL
OBJECT MANIPULATION\f[].
Note that operations performed using this non\-transactional API are
independent from their transactional counterparts.
If any non\-transactional allocations or list manipulations are
performed within an open transaction, the changes will not be
rolled\-back if such a transaction is aborted or interrupted.

the head or at the end of the list, depending on the \f[I]before\f[]

If value is non\-zero the object is inserted at the head, if value is
zero the object is inserted at the end of the list.
The relevant values are available through \f[B]POBJ_LIST_DEST_HEAD\f[]
and \f[B]POBJ_LIST_DEST_TAIL\f[] defines respectively.
The argument \f[I]pe_offset\f[] declares an offset of the structure that
connects the elements in the list.
All the handles \f[I]head\f[], \f[I]dest\f[] and \f[I]oid\f[] must point
to the objects allocated from the same memory pool \f[I]pop\f[].

.SH TYPE\-SAFE NON\-TRANSACTIONAL PERSISTENT ATOMIC LISTS
.PP
The following macros define and operate on a type\-safe persistent
atomic circular doubly linked list data structure that consist of a set
of persistent objects of a well\-known type.
Unlike the functions described in the previous section, these macros
provide type enforcement by requiring declaration of type of the objects
stored in given list, and not allowing mixing objects of different types
in a single list.
.PP
The functionality and semantics of those macros is similar to circular
queues defined in \f[B]queue\f[](3).
.PP
The majority of the macros must specify the handle to the memory pool
\f[I]pop\f[] and the name of the \f[I]field\f[] in the user\-defined

connect the elements in the list.
.PP
A list is headed by a structure defined by the \f[B]POBJ_LIST_HEAD\f[]()
macro.

.SH TRANSACTIONAL OBJECT MANIPULATION
.PP
The functions described in sections \f[B]NON\-TRANSACTIONAL ATOMIC
ALLOCATIONS\f[] and \f[B]NON\-TRANSACTIONAL PERSISTENT ATOMIC LISTS\f[]
only guarantee the atomicity in scope of a single operation on an
object.
In case of more complex changes, involving multiple operations on an
object, or allocation and modification of multiple objects; data
consistency and fail\-safety may be provided only by using \f[I]atomic
transactions\f[].
.PP
A transaction is defined as series of operations on persistent memory
objects that either all occur, or nothing occurs.
In particular, if the execution of a transaction is interrupted by a
power failure or a system crash, it is guaranteed that after system
restart, all the changes made as a part of the uncompleted transaction
will be rolled\-back, restoring the consistent state of the memory pool
from the moment when the transaction was started.
.PP
Note that transactions do not provide the atomicity with respect to
other threads.
All the modifications performed within the transactions are immediately
visible to other threads, and this is the responsibility of the program
to implement a proper thread synchronization mechanism.
.PP
Each transaction is visible only for the thread that started it.
No other threads can add operations, commit or abort the transaction
initiated by another thread.
There may be multiple open transactions on given memory pool at the same
time, but only one transaction per thread.
.PP
Nested transactions are supported but flattened.
Committing the nested transaction does not commit the outer transaction,
however errors in the nested transaction are propagated up to the
outermost level, resulting in the interruption of the entire
transaction.
.PP
Please see the \f[B]CAVEATS\f[] section for known limitations of the
transactional API.

.PP
The \f[B]pmemobj_tx_stage\f[]() function returns the stage of the
current transaction stage for a thread.
Stages are changed only by the \f[B]pmemobj_tx_*\f[]() functions.
The transaction stages are defined as follows:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]TX_STAGE_NONE\f[] \- no open transaction in this thread
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]TX_STAGE_WORK\f[] \- transaction in progress
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]TX_STAGE_ONCOMMIT\f[] \- successfully committed
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]TX_STAGE_ONABORT\f[] \- starting the transaction failed or
transaction aborted

.fi
.PP
The \f[B]pmemobj_tx_begin\f[]() function starts a new transaction in the
current thread.
If called within an open transaction, it starts a nested transaction.
The caller may use \f[I]env\f[] argument to provide a pointer to the
information of a calling environment to be restored in case of
transaction abort.
This information must be filled by a caller, using \f[B]setjmp\f[](3)
macro.
.PP
New transaction may be started only if the current stage is
\f[B]TX_STAGE_NONE\f[] or \f[B]TX_STAGE_WORK\f[].
If successful, transaction stage changes to \f[B]TX_STAGE_WORK\f[] and
function returns zero.
Otherwise, stage changes to \f[B]TX_STAGE_ONABORT\f[] and an error
number is returned.
.PP
Optionally, a list of parameters for the transaction may be provided as
the following arguments.
Each parameter consists of a type and type\-specific number of values.
Currently there are 4 types:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]TX_PARAM_NONE\f[], used as a termination marker (no following
value)
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]TX_PARAM_MUTEX\f[], followed by one pmem\-resident PMEMmutex
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]TX_PARAM_RWLOCK\f[], followed by one pmem\-resident PMEMrwlock
.IP \[bu] 2
(EXPERIMENTAL) \f[B]TX_PARAM_CB\f[], followed by a callback function of
type pmemobj_tx_callback and a void pointer (so 2 values)
.PP
Using \f[B]TX_PARAM_MUTEX\f[] or \f[B]TX_PARAM_RWLOCK\f[] means that at
the beginning of a transaction specified lock will be acquired.
In case of \f[B]TX_PARAM_RWLOCK\f[] it\[aq]s a write lock.
It is guaranteed that \f[B]pmemobj_tx_begin\f[]() will grab all locks
prior to successful completion and they will be held by the current
thread until the outermost transaction is finished.
Locks are taken in the order from left to right.
To avoid deadlocks, user must take care of the proper order of locks.
.PP
\f[B]TX_PARAM_CB\f[] registers specified callback function to be
executed at each transaction stage.
For \f[B]TX_STAGE_WORK\f[] it\[aq]s executed before commit, for all
other stages as a first operation after stage change.
It will also be called after each transaction \- in such case
\f[I]stage\f[] parameter will be set to \f[B]TX_STAGE_NONE\f[].
pmemobj_tx_callback must be compatible with:
.PP
\f[C]void\ func(PMEMobjpool\ *pop,\ enum\ pobj_tx_stage\ stage,\ void\ *arg)\f[]
.PP
\f[I]pop\f[] is a pool identifier used in \f[B]pmemobj_tx_begin\f[](),
\f[I]stage\f[] is a current transaction stage and \f[I]arg\f[] is a
second parameter of \f[B]TX_PARAM_CB\f[].
Without considering transaction nesting this mechanism can be deemed as
an alternative method for executing code between stages (instead of
\f[B]TX_ONCOMMIT\f[], \f[B]TX_ONABORT\f[], etc).
However there are 2 significant differences when nested transactions are
used:
.IP \[bu] 2
Registered function is executed only in the most outer transaction (even
if registered in the inner one).
.IP \[bu] 2
There can be only one callback in the whole transaction (it can\[aq]t be
changed in the inner transaction).
.PP
Note that \f[B]TX_PARAM_CB\f[] does not replace
\f[B]TX_ONCOMMIT\f[]/\f[B]TX_ONABORT\f[]/etc.
macros.
They can be used together \- a callback will be executed \f[I]before\f[]
\f[B]TX_ONCOMMIT\f[]/\f[B]TX_ONABORT\f[]/etc.
section.
.PP
\f[B]TX_PARAM_CB\f[] can be used when the code dealing with transaction
stage changes is shared between multiple users or when it must be
executed only in the outer transaction.
For example it can be very useful when application must synchronize
persistent and transient state.

The \f[B]TX_BEGIN_PARAM\f[](), \f[B]TX_BEGIN_CB\f[]() and
\f[B]TX_BEGIN\f[]() macros start a new transaction in the same way as
\f[B]pmemobj_tx_begin\f[](), except that instead of the environment
buffer provided by a caller, they set up the local \f[I]jmp_buf\f[]
buffer and use it to catch the transaction abort.
The \f[B]TX_BEGIN\f[]() macro starts a transaction without any options.
\f[B]TX_BEGIN_PARAM\f[] may be used in case when there is a need to grab
locks prior to starting a transaction (like for a multi\-threaded
program) or set up transaction stage callback.
\f[B]TX_BEGIN_CB\f[] is just a wrapper around \f[B]TX_BEGIN_PARAM\f[]
that validates callback signature.
(For compatibility there is also \f[B]TX_BEGIN_LOCK\f[] macro which is
an alias for \f[B]TX_BEGIN_PARAM\f[]).
Each of those macros shall be followed by a block of code with all the
operations that are to be performed atomically.

The \f[B]TX_ONABORT\f[] macro starts a block of code that will be

\f[B]pmemobj_tx_begin\f[](), or if the transaction is aborted.
This block is optional, but in practice it should not be omitted.
If it\[aq]s desirable to crash the application when transaction aborts
and there is no \f[B]TX_ONABORT\f[] section, application can define
\f[B]POBJ_TX_CRASH_ON_NO_ONABORT\f[] macro before inclusion of

Similarly to the macros controlling the transaction flow, the
\f[B]libpmemobj\f[] defines a set of macros that simplify the

.SH CAVEATS
.PP
The transaction flow control is governed by the
\f[B]setjmp\f[](3)/\f[B]longjmp\f[](3) macros and they are used in both
the macro and function flavors of the API.
The transaction will longjmp on transaction abort.
This has one major drawback which is described in the ISO C standard
subsection 7.13.2.1.
It says that \f[B]the values of objects of automatic storage duration
that are local to the function containing the setjmp invocation that do
not have volatile\-qualified type and have been changed between the
setjmp invocation and longjmp call are indeterminate.\f[]
.PP
The following example illustrates the issue described above.

Objects which are not volatile\-qualified, are of automatic storage
duration and have been changed between the invocations of
\f[B]setjmp\f[](3) and \f[B]longjmp\f[](3) (that also means within the
work section of the transaction after \f[B]TX_BEGIN\f[]()) should not be
used after a transaction abort or should be used with utmost care.
This also includes code after the \f[B]TX_END\f[] macro.
.PP
\f[B]libpmemobj\f[] is not cancellation\-safe.
The pool will never be corrupted because of canceled thread, but other
threads may stall waiting on locks taken by that thread.
If application wants to use \f[B]pthread_cancel\f[](3), it must disable
cancellation before calling \f[B]libpmemobj\f[] APIs (see
\f[B]pthread_setcancelstate\f[](3) with \f[B]PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE\f[])
and re\-enable it after.
Deferring cancellation (\f[B]pthread_setcanceltype\f[](3) with
\f[B]PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED\f[]) is not safe enough, because
\f[B]libpmemobj\f[] internally may call functions that are specified as
cancellation points in POSIX.
.SH LIBRARY API VERSIONING
.PP
This section describes how the library API is versioned, allowing
applications to work with an evolving API.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
const\ char\ pmemobj_check_version(
\ \ \ \ unsigned\ major_required,
\ \ \ \ unsigned\ minor_required);
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The \f[B]pmemobj_check_version\f[]() function is used to see if the
installed \f[B]libpmemobj\f[] supports the version of the library API
required by an application.
The easiest way to do this is for the application to supply the
compile\-time version information, supplied by defines in
\f[B]<libpmemobj.h>\f[], like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
reason\ =\ pmemobj_check_version(PMEMOBJ_MAJOR_VERSION,
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ PMEMOBJ_MINOR_VERSION);
if\ (reason\ !=\ NULL)\ {
\ \ \ \ /*\ version\ check\ failed,\ reason\ string\ tells\ you\ why\ */
}
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Any mismatch in the major version number is considered a failure, but a
library with a newer minor version number will pass this check since
increasing minor versions imply backwards compatibility.
.PP
An application can also check specifically for the existence of an
interface by checking for the version where that interface was
introduced.
These versions are documented in this man page as follows: unless
otherwise specified, all interfaces described here are available in
version 1.0 of the library.
Interfaces added after version 1.0 will contain the text \f[I]introduced
in version x.y\f[] in the section of this manual describing the feature.
.PP
When the version check performed by \f[B]pmemobj_check_version\f[]() is
successful, the return value is NULL.
Otherwise the return value is a static string describing the reason for
failing the version check.
The string returned by \f[B]pmemobj_check_version\f[]() must not be
modified or freed.
.SH MANAGING LIBRARY BEHAVIOR

.fi
.PP
The \f[B]pmemobj_set_funcs\f[]() function allows an application to
override memory allocation calls used internally by \f[B]libpmemobj\f[].
Passing in NULL for any of the handlers will cause the
\f[B]libpmemobj\f[] default function to be used.
The library does not make heavy use of the system malloc functions, but
it does allocate approximately 4\-8 kilobytes for each memory pool in
use.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
int\ pmemobj_check(const\ char\ *path,\ const\ char\ *layout);
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The \f[B]pmemobj_check\f[]() function performs a consistency check of
the file indicated by \f[I]path\f[] and returns 1 if the memory pool is
found to be consistent.
Any inconsistencies found will cause \f[B]pmemobj_check\f[]() to return
0, in which case the use of the file with \f[B]libpmemobj\f[] will
result in undefined behavior.
The debug version of \f[B]libpmemobj\f[] will provide additional details
on inconsistencies when \f[B]PMEMOBJ_LOG_LEVEL\f[] is at least 1, as
described in the \f[B]DEBUGGING AND ERROR HANDLING\f[] section below.
\f[B]pmemobj_check\f[]() will return \-1 and set \f[I]errno\f[] if it
cannot perform the consistency check due to other errors.
\f[B]pmemobj_check\f[]() opens the given \f[I]path\f[] read\-only so it
never makes any changes to the file.
This function is not supported on Device DAX.
.SH DEBUGGING AND ERROR HANDLING
.PP
Two versions of \f[B]libpmemobj\f[] are typically available on a
development system.
The normal version, accessed when a program is linked using the
\f[B]\-lpmemobj\f[] option, is optimized for performance.
That version skips checks that impact performance and never logs any
trace information or performs any run\-time assertions.
If an error is detected during the call to \f[B]libpmemobj\f[] function,
an application may retrieve an error message describing the reason of
failure using the following function:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
const\ char\ *pmemobj_errormsg(void);
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The \f[B]pmemobj_errormsg\f[]() function returns a pointer to a static
buffer containing the last error message logged for current thread.
The error message may include description of the corresponding error
code (if \f[I]errno\f[] was set), as returned by \f[B]strerror\f[](3).
The error message buffer is thread\-local; errors encountered in one
thread do not affect its value in other threads.
The buffer is never cleared by any library function; its content is
significant only when the return value of the immediately preceding call
to \f[B]libpmemobj\f[] function indicated an error, or if \f[I]errno\f[]
was set.
The application must not modify or free the error message string, but it
may be modified by subsequent calls to other library functions.
.PP
A second version of \f[B]libpmemobj\f[], accessed when a program uses
the libraries under \f[B]/usr/lib/nvml_debug\f[], contains run\-time
assertions and trace points.
The typical way to access the debug version is to set the environment
variable \f[B]LD_LIBRARY_PATH\f[] to \f[B]/usr/lib/nvml_debug\f[] or
\f[B]/usr/lib64/nvml_debug\f[] depending on where the debug libraries
are installed on the system.
The trace points in the debug version of the library are enabled using
the environment variable \f[B]PMEMOBJ_LOG_LEVEL\f[] which can be set to
the following values:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]0\f[] \- This is the default level when \f[B]PMEMOBJ_LOG_LEVEL\f[]
is not set.
No log messages are emitted at this level.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]1\f[] \- Additional details on any errors detected are logged (in
addition to returning the \f[I]errno\f[]\-based errors as usual).
The same information may be retrieved using \f[B]pmemobj_errormsg\f[]().
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]2\f[] \- A trace of basic operations is logged.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]3\f[] \- This level enables a very verbose amount of function call
tracing in the library.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]4\f[] \- This level enables voluminous and fairly obscure tracing
information that is likely only useful to the \f[B]libpmemobj\f[]
developers.
.PP
The environment variable \f[B]PMEMOBJ_LOG_FILE\f[] specifies a file name
where all logging information should be written.
If the last character in the name is "\-", the PID of the current
process will be appended to the file name when the log file is created.
If \f[B]PMEMOBJ_LOG_FILE\f[] is not set, the logging output goes to
stderr.
.PP
Setting the environment variable \f[B]PMEMOBJ_LOG_LEVEL\f[] has no
effect on the non\-debug version of \f[B]libpmemobj\f[].
See also \f[B]libpmem\f[](3) to get information about other environment
variables affecting \f[B]libpmemobj\f[] behavior.
.PP
\f[B]libpmemobj\f[] by default supports up to 1024 parallel transactions
/ allocations.
For debugging purposes it is possible to decrease this value by writing
a desired limit to the \f[B]PMEMOBJ_NLANES\f[] environment variable.
.SH CONTROL AND STATISTICS

behavior as well as reason about its internals.

There are two main functions to that interface:

.nf
\f[C]
int\ pmemobj_ctl_get(PMEMobjpool\ *pop,\ const\ char\ *name,\ void\ *arg);
int\ pmemobj_ctl_set(PMEMobjpool\ *pop,\ const\ char\ *name,\ void\ *arg);
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The \f[I]name\f[] argument specifies an entry point as defined in the
CTL namespace specification.
The entry point description specifies whether the extra \f[I]arg\f[] is
required.
Those two parameters together create a CTL query.
The \f[I]pop\f[] argument is optional if the entry point resides in a
global namespace (i.e.
shared for all the pools).
The functions themselves are thread\-safe and most of the entry points
are too.
If there are special conditions in which an entry point has to be
called, they are explicitly stated in its description.
The functions propagate the return value of the entry point.
If either the name or the provided arguments are invalid, \-1 is
returned.
.PP
Entry points are leafs of a tree\-like structure.
Each one can read from the internal state, write to the internal state
or do both.
.PP
The CTL namespace is organized in a tree structure.
Starting from the root, each node can be either internal, containing
other elements, or a leaf.
Internal nodes themselves can only contain other nodes and cannot be
entry points.
There are two types of those nodes: named and indexed.
Named nodes have string identifiers.
Indexed nodes represent an abstract array index and have an associated
string identifier.
The index itself is user provided.
A collection of indexes present on the path of an entry point is
provided to the handler functions as name and index pairs.
.PP
The entry points are listed in the following format:
.PP
name | r(ead)w(rite) | global/\- | read argument type | write argument
type | config argument type
.PP
description...
.SH CTL NAMESPACE
.PP
prefault.at_create | rw | global | int | int | boolean
.PP
If set, every single page of the pool will be touched and written to, in
order to trigger page allocation.
This can be used to minimize performance impact of pagefaults.
Affects only the \f[B]pmemobj_create()\f[] function.
.PP
Always returns 0.
.PP
prefault.at_open | rw | global | int | int | boolean
.PP
As above, but affects \f[B]pmemobj_open()\f[] function.
.PP
tx.debug.skip_expensive_checks | rw | \- | int | int | boolean
.PP
Turns off some expensive checks performed by transaction module in
"debug" builds.
Ignored in "release" builds.
.PP
tx.cache.size | rw | \- | long long | long long | integer
.PP
Size in bytes of the transaction snapshot cache size.
The bigger it is the frequency of persistent allocations is lower, but
at the cost of higher fixed cost.
.PP
This should be set to roughly the sum of sizes of the snapshotted
regions in an average transaction in the pool.
.PP
This value must be a in a range between 0 and
\f[B]PMEMOBJ_MAX_ALLOC_SIZE\f[].
If the current threshold is larger than the new cache size, the
threshold will be made equal to the new size.
.PP
This entry point is not thread safe and should not be modified if there
are any transactions currently running.
.PP
Returns 0 if successful, \-1 otherwise.
.PP
tx.cache.threshold | rw | \- | long long | long long | integer
.PP
Threshold in bytes to which the snapshots will use the cache.
All bigger snapshots will trigger a persistent allocation.
.PP
This value must be a in a range between 0 and \f[B]tx.cache.size\f[].
.PP
This entry point is not thread safe and should not be modified if there
are any transactions currently running.
.PP
Returns 0 if successful, \-1 otherwise.
.PP
tx.post_commit.queue_depth | rw | \- | int | int | integer
.PP
Controls the depth of the post\-commit tasks queue.
A post\-commit task is the collection of work items that need to be
performed on the persistent state after a successfully completed
transaction.
This includes freeing no longer needed objects and cleaning up various
caches.
By default, this queue does not exist and the post\-commit task is
executed synchronously in the same thread that ran the transaction.
By changing this parameter, one can offload this task to a separate
worker.
If the queue is full, the algorithm, instead of waiting, performs the
post\-commit in the current thread.
.PP
The task is performed on a finite resource (lanes, of which there are
1024), and if the worker threads that process this queue don\[aq]t keep
up with the demand, regular threads might start to block waiting for
that resource.
This will happen if the queue depth value is too large.
.PP
As a general rule, this value should be set to around: 1024 minus the
average number of threads in the application (not counting the
post\-commit workers).
But this may vary from workload to workload.
.PP
The queue depth value must also be a power of two.
.PP
This entry point is not thread\-safe and must be called when no
transactions are currently being executed.
.PP
Returns 0 if successful, \-1 otherwise.
.PP
tx.post_commit.worker | r\- | \- | void * | \- | \-
.PP
The worker function that one needs to launch in a thread to perform
asynchronous processing of post\-commit tasks.
It returns only after a stop entry point is called.
There might be many worker threads at a time.
If there\[aq]s no work to be done, this function sleeps instead of
polling.
.PP
Always returns 0.
.PP
tx.post_commit.stop | r\- | \- | void * | \- | \-
.PP
This function forces all the post\-commit worker functions to exit and
return control back to the calling thread.
This should be called before the application terminates and the post
commit worker threads needs to be shutdown.
.PP
After the invocation of this entry point, the post\-commit task queue
can no longer be used.
If there\[aq]s a need to restart the worker threads after a stop, the
tx.post_commit.queue_depth needs to be set again.
.PP
This entry point must be called when no transactions are currently being
executed.
.PP
Always returns 0.
.SH CTL external configuration
.PP
In addition to direct function call, each write entry point can also be
set using two alternative methods.
.PP
The first one is to load configuration directly from a
\f[B]PMEMOBJ_CONF\f[] environment variable.
Properly formatted ctl config string is a single\-line sequence of
queries separated by \[aq];\[aq]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
query0;query1;...;queryN
\f[]
.fi
.PP
A single query is constructed from the name of the ctl write entry point
and the argument, separated by \[aq]=\[aq]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
entry_point=entry_point_argument
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The entry point argument type is defined by the entry point itself, but
there are few predefined primitives:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
*)\ integer:\ represented\ by\ a\ sequence\ of\ [0\-9]\ characters\ that\ form
\ \ \ \ a\ single\ number.
*)\ boolean:\ represented\ by\ a\ single\ character:\ y/n/Y/N/0/1,\ each
\ \ \ \ corresponds\ to\ true\ or\ false.\ If\ the\ argument\ contains\ any
\ \ \ \ trailing\ characters,\ they\ are\ ignored.
*)\ string:\ a\ simple\ sequence\ of\ characters.
\f[]
.fi
.PP
There are also complex argument types that are formed from the
primitives separated by a \[aq],\[aq]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
first_arg,second_arg
\f[]
.fi
.PP
In summary, a full configuration sequence looks like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
(first_entry_point)=(arguments,\ ...);...;(last_entry_point)=(arguments,\ ...);
\f[]
.fi
.PP
As an example, to set both prefault at_open and at_create variables:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

PMEMOBJ_CONF="prefault.at_open=1;prefault.at_create=1"
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The second method of loading an external configuration is to set the
\f[B]PMEMOBJ_CONF_FILE\f[] environment variable to point to a file that
contains a sequence of ctl queries.
The parsing rules are all the same, but the file can also contain
white\-spaces and comments.
.PP
To create a comment, simply use \[aq]#\[aq] anywhere in a line and
everything afterwards, until a new line \[aq]\[aq], will be ignored.
.PP
An example configuration file:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#########################
#\ My\ pmemobj\ configuration
#########################

#\ Global\ settings:
prefault.\ #\ modify\ the\ behavior\ of\ pre\-faulting
