\f[B]pmempool\-transform\f[] \-\- Modify internal structure of a pool
set.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
pmempool\ transform\ [options]\ <poolset_file_src>\ <poolset_file_dst>
\f[]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]pmempool transform\f[] command modifies internal structure of a
pool set defined by the \f[C]poolset_file_src\f[] file, according to a
structure described in the \f[C]poolset_file_dst\f[] file.
.PP
The following operations are supported:
.IP \[bu] 2
adding replicas \- one or more new replicas can be added and
synchronized with other replicas in the pool set,
.IP \[bu] 2
removing replicas \- one or more replicas can be removed from the pool
set,
.IP \[bu] 2
reordering of replicas \- the order of existing replicas can be changed.
.PP
Currently these operations are allowed only for \f[B]pmemobj\f[] pools
(see \f[B]libpmemobj\f[](3)).
.PP
The \f[I]poolset_file_src\f[] argument provides the source pool set to
be changed.
.PP
The \f[I]poolset_file_dst\f[] argument points to the target pool set.
.PP
When adding or deleting replicas, the two pool set files can differ only
in the definitions of replicas which are to be added or deleted.
One cannot add and remove replicas in the same step.
Only one of these operations can be performed at a time.
Reordering replicas can be combined with any of them.
Also, to add a replica it is necessary for its effective size to match
or exceed the pool size.
Otherwise the whole operation fails and no changes are applied.
Effective size of a replica is the sum of sizes of all its part files
decreased by 4096 bytes per each part file.
The 4096 bytes of each part file is utilized for storing internal
metadata of the pool part files.
.SS Available options:
.TP
.B \f[C]\-d,\ \-\-dry\-run\f[]
Enable dry run mode.
In this mode no changes are applied, only check for viability of the
operation is performed.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[C]\-v,\ \-\-verbose\f[]
Increase verbosity level.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[C]\-h,\ \-\-help\f[]
Display help message and exit.

.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Example 1.
.PP
Let files \f[C]/path/poolset_file_src\f[] and
\f[C]/path/poolset_file_dst\f[] have the following contents:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
PMEMPOOLSET
20M\ /0/partfile1
20M\ /0/partfile2
25M\ /0/partfile3
REPLICA
40M\ /1/partfile1
20M\ /1/partfile2
\f[]
.fi
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
PMEMPOOLSET
20M\ /0/partfile1
20M\ /0/partfile2
25M\ /0/partfile3
REPLICA
40M\ /1/partfile1
20M\ /1/partfile2
REPLICA
50M\ /2/partfile1
20M\ /2/partfile2
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Then, the command
.PP
\f[C]pmempool\ transform\ /path/poolset_file_src\ /path/poolset_file_dst\f[]
.PP
adds a replica to the pool set.
All other replicas remain unchanged and the size of the pool remains
60M.
.SS Example 2.
.PP
Let files \f[C]/path/poolset_file_src\f[] and
\f[C]/path/poolset_file_dst\f[] have the following contents:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
PMEMPOOLSET
20M\ /0/partfile1
20M\ /0/partfile2
25M\ /0/partfile3
REPLICA
40M\ /1/partfile1
20M\ /1/partfile2
\f[]
.fi
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
PMEMPOOLSET
20M\ /0/partfile1
20M\ /0/partfile2
25M\ /0/partfile3
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Then
.PP
\f[C]pmempool_transform\ /path/poolset_file_src\ /path/poolset_file_dst\f[]
.PP
deletes the second replica from the pool set.
The first replica remains unchanged and the size of the pool is still
60M.
