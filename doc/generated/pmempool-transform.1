\f[B]pmempool\-transform\f[] \- Modify internal structure of a pool set.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
pmempool\ transform\ [options]\ <poolset_file_src>\ <poolset_file_dst>
\f[]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]pmempool transform\f[] command modifies internal structure of a
pool set defined by the \f[C]poolset_file_src\f[] file, according to a
structure described in the \f[C]poolset_file_dst\f[] file.
.PP
The following operations are supported:
.IP \[bu] 2
adding replicas \- one or more new replicas can be added and
synchronized with other replicas in the pool set,
.IP \[bu] 2
removing replicas \- one or more replicas can be removed from the pool
set ,
.IP \[bu] 2
adding or removing pool set options.
.PP
Only one of the above operations can be performed at a time.
.PP
Currently adding and removing replicas are allowed only for
\f[B]pmemobj\f[] pools (see \f[B]libpmemobj\f[](7)).
.PP
The \f[I]poolset_file_src\f[] argument provides the source pool set to
be changed.
.PP
The \f[I]poolset_file_dst\f[] argument points to the target pool set.
.PP
When adding or deleting replicas, the two pool set files can differ only
in the definitions of replicas which are to be added or deleted.
When adding or removing pool set options (see \f[B]poolset\f[](5)), the
rest of both pool set files have to be of the same structure.
The operation of adding/removing a pool set option can be performed on a
pool set with local replicas only.
To add/remove a pool set option to/from a pool set with remote replicas,
one has to remove the remote replicas first, then add/remove the option,
and finally recreate the remote replicas having added/removed the pool
set option to/from the remote replicas' poolset files.
To add a replica it is necessary for its effective size to match or
exceed the pool size.
Otherwise the whole operation fails and no changes are applied.
If none of the poolset options is used, the effective size of a replica
is the sum of sizes of all its part files decreased by 4096 bytes per
each part file.
The 4096 bytes of each part file is utilized for storing internal
metadata of the pool part files.
If the option \f[I]SINGLEHDR\f[] is used, the effective size of a
replica is the sum of sizes of all its part files decreased once by 4096
bytes.
In this case only the first part contains internal metadata.
If the option \f[I]NOHDRS\f[] is used, the effective size of a replica
is the sum of sizes of all its part files.
In this case none of the parts contains internal metadata.
.SS Available options:
.TP
.B \f[C]\-d,\ \-\-dry\-run\f[]
Enable dry run mode.
In this mode no changes are applied, only check for viability of the
operation is performed.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[C]\-v,\ \-\-verbose\f[]
Increase verbosity level.
.RS

.TP
.B \f[C]\-h,\ \-\-help\f[]

.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Example 1.
.PP
Let files \f[C]/path/poolset_file_src\f[] and
\f[C]/path/poolset_file_dst\f[] have the following contents:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
PMEMPOOLSET
20M\ /0/partfile1
20M\ /0/partfile2
25M\ /0/partfile3
REPLICA
40M\ /1/partfile1
20M\ /1/partfile2
\f[]
.fi
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
PMEMPOOLSET
20M\ /0/partfile1
20M\ /0/partfile2
25M\ /0/partfile3
REPLICA
40M\ /1/partfile1
20M\ /1/partfile2
REPLICA
50M\ /2/partfile1
20M\ /2/partfile2
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Then, the command
.PP
\f[C]pmempool\ transform\ /path/poolset_file_src\ /path/poolset_file_dst\f[]
.PP
adds a replica to the pool set.
All other replicas remain unchanged and the size of the pool remains
60M.
.SS Example 2.
.PP
Let files \f[C]/path/poolset_file_src\f[] and
\f[C]/path/poolset_file_dst\f[] have the following contents:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
PMEMPOOLSET
20M\ /0/partfile1
20M\ /0/partfile2
25M\ /0/partfile3
REPLICA
40M\ /1/partfile1
20M\ /1/partfile2
\f[]
.fi
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
PMEMPOOLSET
20M\ /0/partfile1
20M\ /0/partfile2
25M\ /0/partfile3
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Then
.PP
\f[C]pmempool_transform\ /path/poolset_file_src\ /path/poolset_file_dst\f[]
.PP
deletes the second replica from the pool set.
The first replica remains unchanged and the size of the pool is still
60M.
