.SH NAME
.PP
\f[B]pmempool\-sync\f[] \-\- Synchronize replicas or their parts within
a pool set.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
pmempool\ sync\ [options]\ <poolset_file>
\f[]
.fi
.PP
NOTE: Only the pool set file used to create the pool should be used for
syncing the pool.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]pmempool sync\f[] command synchronizes data between replicas
within a pool set.
It checks if metadata of all replicas in a pool set are consistent, i.e.
all parts are healthy, and if any of them is not, the corrupted or
missing parts are recreated and filled with data from one of the healthy
replicas.
Currently synchronizing data is allowed only for \f[B]pmemobj\f[] pools
(see \f[B]libpmemobj\f[](3)).
.SS Available options:
.TP
.B \f[C]\-d,\ \-\-dry\-run\f[]
Enable dry run mode.
In this mode no changes are applied, only check for viability of
synchronization.
