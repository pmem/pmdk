pmemcto_malloc_usable_size \-\- obtain size of block of memory allocated
from pool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#include\ <libpmemcto.h>

size_t\ pmemcto_malloc_usable_size(PMEMctopool\ *pcp,\ void\ *ptr);
\f[]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]pmemcto_malloc_usable_size\f[]() function provides the same
semantics as \f[B]malloc_usable_size\f[](3), but operates on the memory
pool \f[I]pcp\f[] instead of the process heap supplied by the system.
It returns the number of usable bytes in the block of allocated memory
pointed to by \f[I]ptr\f[], a pointer to a block of memory allocated by
\f[B]pmemcto_malloc\f[]() or a related function.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
The \f[B]pmemcto_malloc_usable_size\f[]() function returns the number of
usable bytes in the block of allocated memory pointed to by
\f[I]ptr\f[].
If \f[I]ptr\f[] is NULL, 0 is returned.
.SH ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
.PP
\f[B]libpmemcto\f[] depends on jemalloc, written by Jason Evans, to do
the heavy lifting of managing dynamic memory allocation.
See: <http://www.canonware.com/jemalloc>
.PP
\f[B]libpmemcto\f[] builds on the persistent memory programming model
recommended by the SNIA NVM Programming Technical Work Group:
<http://snia.org/nvmp>
