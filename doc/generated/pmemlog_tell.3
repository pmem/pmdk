.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]pmemlog_tell\f[]() function returns the current write point for
the log, expressed as a byte offset into the usable log space in the
memory pool.
This offset starts off as zero on a newly\-created log, and is
incremented by each successful append operation.
This function can be used to determine how much data is currently in the
log.
.PP
The \f[B]pmemlog_rewind\f[]() function resets the current write point
for the log to zero.
After this call, the next append adds to the beginning of the log.
.PP
The \f[B]pmemlog_walk\f[]() function walks through the log \f[I]plp\f[],
from beginning to end, calling the callback function
\f[I]process_chunk\f[] for each \f[I]chunksize\f[] block of data found.
The argument \f[I]arg\f[] is also passed to the callback to help avoid
the need for global state.
The \f[I]chunksize\f[] argument is useful for logs with fixed\-length
records and may be specified as 0 to cause a single call to the callback
with the entire log contents passed as the \f[I]buf\f[] argument.
The \f[I]len\f[] argument tells the \f[I]process_chunk\f[] function how
much data \f[I]buf\f[] is holding.
The callback function should return 1 if \f[B]pmemlog_walk\f[]() should
continue walking through the log, or 0 to terminate the walk.
The callback function is called while holding \f[B]libpmemlog\f[](7)
internal locks that make calls atomic, so the callback function must not
try to append to the log itself or deadlock will occur.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
On success, \f[B]pmemlog_tell\f[]() returns the current write point for
the log.
On error, it returns \-1 and sets \f[I]errno\f[] appropriately.
.PP
The \f[B]pmemlog_rewind\f[]() and \f[B]pmemlog_walk\f[]() functions
return no value.
