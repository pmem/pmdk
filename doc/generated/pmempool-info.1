\f[B]pmempool\-info\f[] \[en] show information about persistent memory
pool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ pmempool\ info\ [<options>]\ <file>
\f[]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]pmempool\f[] invoked with \f[I]info\f[] command analyzes an
existing pool created by \f[B]PMDK\f[] libraries provided by
\f[B]file\f[] parameter.
The \f[B]file\f[] can be either existing pool file, a part file or a
poolset file.
.PP
The main task of this command is to print all usable information from
pool headers and user data in human readable format.
It automatically recognizes the pool type by parsing and analyzing the
pool header.
The recognition is done by checking the signature in the pool header.
The main job of \f[I]info\f[] command is to present internal data
structures as they are stored in file but \f[I]not\f[] for checking
consistency.
For this purpose there is the \f[B]pmempool\-check\f[](1) command
available.
.PP
The \f[B]pmempool\f[] with \f[I]info\f[] command analyzes pool file as
long as it is possible regarding \f[I]correctness\f[] of internal
meta\-data (correct offsets, sizes etc.).
If it is \f[I]not\f[] possible to analyze the rest of the file,
\f[B]pmempool\f[] exits with error code and prints appropriate error
message.
.PP
Currently there is lack of interprocess synchronization for pool files,
so the \f[I]info\f[] command should be invoked off\-line.
Using \f[B]pmempool\f[] on pool file which may be modified by another
process may lead to unexpected errors in pool file.
.PP
A poolset file passed to \f[B]pmempool info\f[] may contain multiple
replicas, also remote ones, but \f[B]pmempool\f[] currently does not
read any data from remote replicas.
It prints only a remote node address and a remote replica descriptor.
.PP
\f[B]pmempool info\f[] opens pool file in \f[I]read\-only\f[] mode so
the file will remain untouched after processing.
.PP
The \f[I]info\f[] command may collect and print basic statistics about
data usage.
The statistics are specific to the type of pool.
See \f[B]STATISTICS\f[] section for details.
.PP
Although the pool consistency is \f[I]not\f[] checked by the
\f[I]info\f[] command, it prints information about checksum errors
and/or offsets errors.
.SS Common options:
.PP
By default the \f[I]info\f[] command of \f[B]pmempool\f[] prints
information about the most important internal data structures from pool.
The particular set of headers and meta\-data depend on pool type.
The pool type is recognized automatically and appropriate information is
displayed in human\-readable format.
.PP
To force processing specified file(s) as desired pool type use
\f[B]\-f\f[] option with appropriate name of pool type.
The valid names off pool types are \f[B]blk\f[], \f[B]log\f[],
\f[B]obj\f[] or \f[B]btt\f[].
This option may be useful when the pool header is corrupted and
automatic recognition of pool type fails.
.PP
\f[C]\-f,\ \-\-force\ blk|log|obj|btt\f[]
.PP
Force parsing pool as specified pool type.
.RS
.PP
NOTE: By default only pool headers and internal meta\-data are
displayed.
To display user data use \f[B]\-d\f[] option.
Using \f[B]\-r\f[] option you can specify number of blocks/bytes/data
chunks or objects using special text format.
See \f[B]RANGE\f[] section for details.
The range refers to \f[I]block numbers\f[] in case of pmem blk pool
type, to \f[I]chunk numbers\f[] in case of pmem log pool type and to
\f[I]object numbers\f[] in case of pmem obj pool type.
See \f[B]EXAMPLES\f[] section for an example of usage of these options.
.RE
.PP
\f[C]\-d,\ \-\-data\f[]
.PP
Dump user data in hexadecimal format.
In case of pmem \f[I]blk\f[] pool type data is dumped in
\f[I]blocks\f[].
In case of pmem \f[I]log\f[] pool type data is dumped as a wholeor in
\f[I]chunks\f[] if \f[B]\-w\f[] option is used (See \f[B]Options for
PMEMLOG\f[] section for details).
.PP
\f[C]\-r,\ \-\-range\ <range>\f[]
.PP
Range of blocks/data chunks/objects/zone headers/chunk headers/lanes.
See \f[B]RANGE\f[] section for details about range format.
.PP
\f[C]\-n,\ \-\-human\f[]
.PP
Print sizes in human\-readable format with appropriate units (e.g.\ 4k,
8M, 16G)
.PP
\f[C]\-x,\ \-\-headers\-hex\f[]
.PP
Print pool's internal data in mixed format which consists of hexadecimal
dump of header's data and parsed format displayed in human\-readable
format.
This allows one to see how data is stored in file.
.PP
\f[C]\-s,\ \-\-stats\f[]
.PP
Print pool's statistics.
See \f[B]STATISTICS\f[] section for details.
.PP
\f[C]\-k,\ \-\-badblocks\f[]
.PP
Print bad blocks found in the pool.
.PP
\f[C]\-h,\ \-\-help\f[]
.PP
Display help message and exit.
.SS Options for PMEMLOG:
.PP
\f[C]\-w,\ \-\-walk\ <size>\f[]
.PP
Use this option to walk through used data with fixed data chunk size.
See \f[B]pmemlog_walk\f[](3) in \f[B]libpmemlog\f[](7) for details.
.SS Options for PMEMBLK:
.PP
By default the \f[I]info\f[] command displays the \f[B]pmemblk\f[]
header and BTT (Block Translation Table) Info header in case of
\f[B]pmemblk\f[] pool type.
.PP
To display BTT Map and/or BTT FLOG (Free List and Log) use \f[B]\-m\f[]
and \f[B]\-g\f[] options respectively or increase verbosity level.
.PP
In order to display BTT Info header backup use \f[B]\-B\f[] option.
.PP
\f[C]\-m,\ \-\-map\f[]
.PP
Print BTT Map entries.
.PP
\f[C]\-g,\ \-\-flog\f[]
.PP
Print BTT FLOG entries.
.PP
\f[C]\-B,\ \-\-backup\f[]
.PP
Print BTT Info header backup.
.RS
.PP
NOTE: By default the \f[I]info\f[] command displays all data blocks when
\f[B]\-d\f[] options is used.
However it is possible to skip blocks marked with \f[I]zero\f[] and/or
\f[I]error\f[] flags.
It is also possible to skip blocks which are \f[I]not\f[] marked with
any flag.
Skipping blocks has impact on blocks ranges (e.g.\ display 10 blocks
marked with error flag in the range from 0 to 10000) and statistics.
