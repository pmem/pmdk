.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This section describes the \f[I]malloc\f[]\-like API provided by
\f[B]libvmem\f[](7).
These functions provide the same semantics as their libc namesakes, but
operate on the memory pools specified by their first arguments.
.PP
The \f[B]vmem_malloc\f[]() function provides the same semantics as
\f[B]malloc\f[](3), but operates on the memory pool \f[I]vmp\f[] instead
of the process heap supplied by the system.
It allocates specified \f[I]size\f[] bytes.
.PP
The \f[B]vmem_free\f[]() function provides the same semantics as
\f[B]free\f[](3), but operates on the memory pool \f[I]vmp\f[] instead
of the process heap supplied by the system.
It frees the memory space pointed to by \f[I]ptr\f[], which must have
been returned by a previous call to \f[B]vmem_malloc\f[](),
\f[B]vmem_calloc\f[]() or \f[B]vmem_realloc\f[]() for \f[I]the same pool
of memory\f[].
If \f[I]ptr\f[] is NULL, no operation is performed.
.PP
The \f[B]vmem_calloc\f[]() function provides the same semantics as
\f[B]calloc\f[](3), but operates on the memory pool \f[I]vmp\f[] instead
of the process heap supplied by the system.
It allocates memory for an array of \f[I]nmemb\f[] elements of
\f[I]size\f[] bytes each.
The memory is set to zero.
.PP
The \f[B]vmem_realloc\f[]() function provides the same semantics as
\f[B]realloc\f[](3), but operates on the memory pool \f[I]vmp\f[]
instead of the process heap supplied by the system.
It changes the size of the memory block pointed to by \f[I]ptr\f[] to
\f[I]size\f[] bytes.
The contents will be unchanged in the range from the start of the region
up to the minimum of the old and new sizes.
If the new size is larger than the old size, the added memory will
\f[I]not\f[] be initialized.
.PP
Unless \f[I]ptr\f[] is NULL, it must have been returned by an earlier
call to \f[B]vmem_malloc\f[](), \f[B]vmem_calloc\f[]() or
\f[B]vmem_realloc\f[]().
If \f[I]ptr\f[] is NULL, then the call is equivalent to
\f[I]vmem_malloc(vmp, size)\f[], for all values of \f[I]size\f[]; if
\f[I]size\f[] is equal to zero, and \f[I]ptr\f[] is not NULL, then the
call is equivalent to \f[I]vmem_free(vmp, ptr)\f[].
.PP
The \f[B]vmem_aligned_alloc\f[]() function provides the same semantics
as \f[B]aligned_alloc\f[](3), but operates on the memory pool
\f[I]vmp\f[] instead of the process heap supplied by the system.
It allocates \f[I]size\f[] bytes from the memory pool.
The memory address will be a multiple of \f[I]alignment\f[], which must
be a power of two.
.PP
The \f[B]vmem_strdup\f[]() function provides the same semantics as
\f[B]strdup\f[](3), but operates on the memory pool \f[I]vmp\f[] instead
of the process heap supplied by the system.
Memory for the new string is obtained with \f[B]vmem_malloc\f[](), on
the given memory pool, and can be freed with \f[B]vmem_free\f[]() on the
same memory pool.
.PP
The \f[B]vmem_wcsdup\f[]() function provides the same semantics as
\f[B]wcsdup\f[](3), but operates on the memory pool \f[I]vmp\f[] instead
of the process heap supplied by the system.
Memory for the new string is obtained with \f[B]vmem_malloc\f[](), on
the given memory pool, and can be freed with \f[B]vmem_free\f[]() on the
same memory pool.
.PP
The \f[B]vmem_malloc_usable_size\f[]() function provides the same
semantics as \f[B]malloc_usable_size\f[](3), but operates on the memory
pool \f[I]vmp\f[] instead of the process heap supplied by the system.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
On success, \f[B]vmem_malloc\f[]() returns a pointer to the allocated
memory.
If \f[I]size\f[] is 0, then \f[B]vmem_malloc\f[]() returns either NULL,
or a unique pointer value that can later be successfully passed to
\f[B]vmem_free\f[]().
If \f[B]vmem_malloc\f[]() is unable to satisfy the allocation request,
it returns NULL and sets \f[I]errno\f[] appropriately.
.PP
The \f[B]vmem_free\f[]() function returns no value.
Undefined behavior occurs if frees do not correspond to allocated memory
from the same memory pool.
.PP
On success, \f[B]vmem_calloc\f[]() returns a pointer to the allocated
memory.
If \f[I]nmemb\f[] or \f[I]size\f[] is 0, then \f[B]vmem_calloc\f[]()
returns either NULL, or a unique pointer value that can later be
successfully passed to \f[B]vmem_free\f[]().
If \f[B]vmem_calloc\f[]() is unable to satisfy the allocation request,
it returns NULL and sets \f[I]errno\f[] appropriately.
.PP
On success, \f[B]vmem_realloc\f[]() returns a pointer to the allocated
memory, which may be different from \f[I]ptr\f[].
If the area pointed to was moved, a \f[I]vmem_free(vmp, ptr)\f[] is
done.
If \f[B]vmem_realloc\f[]() is unable to satisfy the allocation request,
it returns NULL and sets \f[I]errno\f[] appropriately.
.PP
On success, \f[B]vmem_aligned_alloc\f[]() returns a pointer to the
allocated memory.
If \f[B]vmem_aligned_alloc\f[]() is unable to satisfy the allocation
request, it returns NULL and sets \f[I]errno\f[] appropriately.
.PP
On success, \f[B]vmem_strdup\f[]() returns a pointer to a new string
which is a duplicate of the string \f[I]s\f[].
If \f[B]vmem_strdup\f[]() is unable to satisfy the allocation request,
it returns NULL and sets \f[I]errno\f[] appropriately.
.PP
On success, \f[B]vmem_wcsdup\f[]() returns a pointer to a new wide
character string which is a duplicate of the wide character string
\f[I]s\f[].
If \f[B]vmem_wcsdup\f[]() is unable to satisfy the allocation request,
it returns NULL and sets \f[I]errno\f[] appropriately.
.PP
The \f[B]vmem_malloc_usable_size\f[]() function returns the number of
usable bytes in the block of allocated memory pointed to by
\f[I]ptr\f[], a pointer to a block of memory allocated by
\f[B]vmem_malloc\f[]() or a related function.
If \f[I]ptr\f[] is NULL, 0 is returned.
