\f[B]pmempool\-check\f[] \[en] check and repair persistent memory pool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ pmempool\ check\ [<options>]\ <file>
\f[]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]pmempool\f[] invoked with \f[I]check\f[] command checks
consistency of a given pool file.
If the pool file is consistent \f[B]pmempool\f[] exits with 0 value.
If the pool file is not consistent non\-zero error code is returned.
.PP
In case of any errors, the proper message is printed.
The verbosity level may be increased using \f[B]\-v\f[] option.
The output messages may be also suppressed using \f[B]\-q\f[] option.
.PP
It is possible to try to fix encountered problems using \f[B]\-r\f[]
option.
In order to be sure this will not corrupt your data you can either
create backup of the pool file using \f[B]\-b\f[] option or just print
what would be fixed without modifying original pool using \f[B]\-N\f[]
option.
.RS
.PP
NOTE: Currently, checking the consistency of a \f[I]pmemobj\f[] pool is
\f[B]not\f[] supported.
.RE
.SS Available options:
.PP
\f[C]\-r,\ \-\-repair\f[]
