.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
All of the functions described so far have an immediate effect on the
persistent state of the pool, and as such, the cost of maintaining
fail\-safety is paid outright and, most importantly, in the calling
thread.
This behavior makes implementing algorithms involving relaxed
consistency guarantees difficult, if not outright impossible.
.PP
The following set of functions introduce a mechanism that allows one to
delay the persistent publication of a set of prepared actions to an
arbitrary moment in time of the execution of a program.
.PP
The publication is fail\-safe atomic in the scope of the entire
collection of actions, but the number of said actions is limited by
\f[I]POBJ_MAX_ACTIONS\f[] constant.
If a program exists without publishing the actions, or the actions are
canceled, any resources reserved by those actions are released and
placed back in the pool.
.PP
A single action is represented by a single \f[C]struct\ pobj_action\f[].
Functions that create actions take that structure by pointer, whereas
functions that publish actions take array of actions and the size of the
array.
The actions can be created, and published, from different threads.
When creating actions, the \f[I]act\f[] argument must be non\-NULL and
point to a \f[C]struct\ pobj_action\f[], the structure will be populated
by the function and must not be modified or deallocated until after
publishing.
.PP
The \f[B]pmemobj_reserve\f[]() functions performs a transient
reservation of an object.
Behaves similarly to \f[B]pmemobj_alloc\f[](3), but performs no
modification to the persistent state.
The object returned by this function can be freely modified without
worrying about fail\-safe atomicity until the object has been published.
Any modifications of the object must be manually persisted, just like in
the case of the atomic API.
.PP
\f[B]pmemobj_xreserve\f[]() is equivalent to \f[B]pmemobj_reserve\f[](),
but with an additional \f[I]flags\f[] argument that is a bitmask of the
following values:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]POBJ_XALLOC_ZERO\f[] \- zero the object
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]POBJ_CLASS_ID(class_id)\f[] \- allocate the object from allocation
class \f[I]class_id\f[].
The class id cannot be 0.
.PP
The \f[B]pmemobj_set_value\f[] function prepares an action that, once
published, will modify the memory location pointed to by \f[I]ptr\f[] to
\f[I]value\f[].
.PP
The \f[B]pmemobj_publish\f[] function publishes the provided set of
actions.
The publication is fail\-safe atomic.
Once done, the persistent state will reflect the changes contained in
the actions.
The \f[I]actvcnt\f[] cannot exceed \f[I]POBJ_MAX_ACTIONS\f[].
.PP
The \f[B]pmemobj_tx_publish\f[] function moves the provided actions to
the scope of the transaction in which it is called.
Only object reservations are supported in transactional publish.
Once done, the reserved objects will follow normal transactional
semantics.
Can only be called during \f[I]TX_STAGE_WORK\f[].
.PP
The \f[B]pmemobj_cancel\f[] function releases any resources held by the
provided set of actions and invalidates all actions.
.PP
The \f[B]POBJ_RESERVE_NEW\f[] macro is a typed variant of
\f[B]pmemobj_reserve\f[].
The size of the reservation is determined from the provided type
\f[I]t\f[].
.PP
The \f[B]POBJ_RESERVE_ALLOC\f[] macro is a typed variant of
\f[B]pmemobj_reserve\f[].
The \f[I]size\f[] of the reservation is user\-provided.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
The following code shows atomic append of two objects into a singly
linked list.

.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
On success, \f[B]pmemobj_reserve\f[]() functions return a handle to the
newly reserved object, otherwise an \f[I]OID_NULL\f[] is returned.
.PP
On success, \f[B]pmemobj_tx_publish\f[]() returns 0, otherwise, stage
changes to \f[I]TX_STAGE_ONABORT\f[] and \f[I]errno\f[] is set
appropriately
