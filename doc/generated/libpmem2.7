\f[B]libpmem2\f[R] \- persistent memory support library (EXPERIMENTAL)

.SH DESCRIPTION

XXX: explain the concept of the granularity
.SH CAVEATS
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.SH DEBUGGING
.PP
Two versions of \f[B]libpmem2\f[R] are typically available on a
development system.
The normal version, accessed when a program is linked using the
\f[B]\-lpmem2\f[R] option, is optimized for performance.
That version skips checks that impact performance and never logs any
trace information or performs any run\-time assertions.
.PP
A second version of \f[B]libpmem2\f[R], accessed when a program uses the
libraries under \f[B]/usr/lib/pmdk_debug\f[R], contains run\-time
assertions and trace points.
The typical way to access the debug version is to set the environment
variable \f[B]LD_LIBRARY_PATH\f[R] to \f[B]/usr/lib/pmdk_debug\f[R] or
\f[B]/usr/lib64/pmdk_debug\f[R], as appropriate.
Debugging output is controlled using the following environment
variables.
These variables have no effect on the non\-debug version of the library.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEM2_LOG_LEVEL\f[R]
.PP
The value of \f[B]PMEM2_LOG_LEVEL\f[R] enables trace points in the debug
version of the library, as follows:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]0\f[R] \- This is the default level when \f[B]PMEM2_LOG_LEVEL\f[R]
is not set.
No log messages are emitted at this level.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]1\f[R] \- Additional details on any errors detected are logged, in
addition to returning the \f[I]errno\f[R]\-based errors as usual.
The same information may be retrieved using \f[B]pmem2_errormsg\f[R]().
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]2\f[R] \- A trace of basic operations is logged.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]3\f[R] \- Enables a very verbose amount of function call tracing in
the library.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]4\f[R] \- Enables voluminous and fairly obscure tracing information
that is likely only useful to the \f[B]libpmem2\f[R] developers.
.PP
Unless \f[B]PMEM2_LOG_FILE\f[R] is set, debugging output is written to
\f[I]stderr\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEM2_LOG_FILE\f[R]
.PP
Specifies the name of a file where all logging information should be
written.
If the last character in the name is \[lq]\-\[rq], the \f[I]PID\f[R] of
the current process will be appended to the file name when the log file
is created.
If \f[B]PMEM2_LOG_FILE\f[R] is not set, output is written to
\f[I]stderr\f[R].
