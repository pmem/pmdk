pmemcto_wcsdup \-\- duplicate a wide\-char string
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#include\ <libpmemcto.h>

wchar_t\ *pmemcto_wcsdup(PMEMctopool\ *pcp,\ const\ wchar_t\ *s);
\f[]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]pmemcto_wcsdup\f[]() function provides the same semantics as
\f[B]wcsdup\f[](3), but operates on the memory pool \f[I]pcp\f[] instead
of the process heap supplied by the system.
It returns a pointer to a new wide\-char string which is a duplicate of
the string \f[I]s\f[].
Memory for the new string is obtained with \f[B]pmemcto_malloc\f[](3),
on the given memory pool, and can be freed with \f[B]pmemcto_free\f[](3)
on the same memory pool.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
On success, the \f[B]pmemcto_wcsdup\f[]() function returns a pointer to
the duplicated string.
If \f[B]pmemcto_wcsdup\f[]() is unable to satisfy the allocation
request, a NULL pointer is returned and \f[I]errno\f[] is set
appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
\f[B]ENOMEM\f[] Insufficient memory available to allocate duplicated
string.
.SH ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
.PP
\f[B]libpmemcto\f[] depends on jemalloc, written by Jason Evans, to do
the heavy lifting of managing dynamic memory allocation.
See: <http://www.canonware.com/jemalloc>
.PP
\f[B]libpmemcto\f[] builds on the persistent memory programming model
recommended by the SNIA NVM Programming Technical Work Group:
<http://snia.org/nvmp>
