pmemcto_set_root_pointer, pmemcto_get_root_pointer \-\- set or obtain
the root object pointer
.SH SYNOPSIS

.nf
\f[C]
#include\ <libpmemcto.h>

void\ pmemcto_set_root_pointer(PMEMctopool\ *pcp,\ void\ *ptr);
void\ *pmemcto_get_root_pointer(PMEMctopool\ *pcp);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The root object of persistent memory pool is an entry point for all
other persistent objects allocated using the \f[B]libpmemcto\f[](7)
APIs.
In other words, every single object stored in persistent memory pool
should have the root object at the end of its reference path.
There is exactly one root object in each pool.
.PP
The \f[B]pmemcto_set_root_pointer\f[]() function saves the pointer to
the root object in given pool.
The \f[I]ptr\f[] must have been returned by a previous call to
\f[B]pmemcto_malloc\f[](3), \f[B]pmemcto_calloc\f[](3) or
\f[B]pmemcto_realloc\f[](3) for \f[I]the same pool of memory\f[].
.PP
The \f[B]pmemcto_get_root_pointer\f[]() function returns the pointer to
the root object in given pool, or NULL if the root pointer was never
set.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
The \f[B]pmemcto_set_root_pointer\f[]() function returns no value.
.PP
The \f[B]pmemcto_get_root_pointer\f[]() function returns the pointer to
the root object in given pool, or NULL if the root pointer was never
set.
