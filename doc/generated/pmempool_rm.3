\f[B]pmempool_rm\f[]() \- remove persistent memory pool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#include\ <libpmempool.h>

int\ pmempool_rm(const\ char\ *path,\ int\ flags);
\f[]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]pmempool_rm\f[]() function removes the pool pointed to by
\f[I]path\f[].
The \f[I]path\f[] can point to a regular file, device dax or pool set
file.
If \f[I]path\f[] is a pool set file, \f[B]pmempool_rm\f[]() will remove
all part files from local replicas using \f[B]unlink\f[](2), and all
remote replicas using \f[B]rpmem_remove\f[](3) (see
\f[B]librpmem\f[](7)), before removing the pool set file itself.
.PP
The \f[I]flags\f[] argument determines the behavior of
\f[B]pmempool_rm\f[]().
It is either 0 or the bitwise OR of one or more of the following flags:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEMPOOL_RM_FORCE\f[] \- Ignore all errors when removing part files
from local or remote replicas.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEMPOOL_RM_POOLSET_LOCAL\f[] \- Also remove local pool set file.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEMPOOL_RM_POOLSET_REMOTE\f[] \- Also remove remote pool set file.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
On success, \f[B]pmempool_rm\f[]() returns 0.
On error, it returns \-1 and sets \f[I]errno\f[] accordingly.
