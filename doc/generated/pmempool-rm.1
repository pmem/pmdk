\f[B]pmempool\-rm\f[] \-\- remove a persistent memory pool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ pmempool\ rm\ [<options>]\ <file>..
\f[]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]pmempool rm\f[] command removes each specified file.
If the specified file is a pool set file, all pool files (single\-file
pool or part files) and remote replicas are removed.
By default the \f[B]pmempool rm\f[] does not remove pool set files.
All local and remote pool files are removed using \f[B]unlink\f[](3)
call, except the pools created on \f[B]device dax\f[] which are zeroed
instead.
If specified file does not exist, the remote pool is broken or not
accessible, the \f[B]pmempool rm\f[] command terminates with an error
code.
By default it prompts before removing \f[I]write\-protected\f[] local
files.
See \f[B]REMOTE REPLICATION\f[] section for more details about support
for remote pools.
See \f[B]EXAMPLES\f[] section for example usage of the \f[I]rm\f[]
command.
.SS Available options:
.PP
\f[C]\-h,\ \-\-help\f[]
.PP

.PP
\f[C]\-l,\ \-\-local\f[]
.PP

.PP
\f[C]\-r,\ \-\-remote\f[]
.PP
Remove remote pool set files.
.PP
\f[C]\-f,\ \-\-force\f[]
.PP
Remove all specified files, ignore nonexistent files, never prompt.
.PP
\f[C]\-i,\ \-\-interactive\f[]
.PP
Prompt before removing every single file or remote pool.
.SH REMOTE REPLICATION
.PP
A remote pool is removed using \f[B]rpmem_remove\f[](3) function if
\f[B]librpmem\f[](7) library is available.
If a pool set file contains remote replication but \f[B]librpmem\f[](7)
is not available, the \f[B]pmempool rm\f[] command terminates with an
error code, unless the \f[B]\-f, \-\-force\f[] option is specified.
