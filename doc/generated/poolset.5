poolset \-\- persistent memory pool configuration file format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
mypool.set
\f[]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Depending on the configuration of the system, the available
non\-volatile memory space may be divided into multiple memory devices.
In such case, the maximum size of the transactional object store could
be limited by the capacity of a single memory device.
Therefore, \f[B]libpmemobj\f[](7), \f[B]libpmemblk\f[](7) and
\f[B]libpmemlog\f[](7) allow building object stores spanning multiple
memory devices by creation of persistent memory pools consisting of
multiple files, where each part of such a \f[I]pool set\f[] may be
stored on a different pmem\-aware filesystem.
.PP
To improve reliability and eliminate single point of failure,
\f[B]libpmemobj\f[](7) also allows all the data written to a persistent
memory pool to be copied to local or remote pool \f[I]replicas\f[],
thereby providing backup for the persistent memory pool by producing a
\f[I]mirrored pool set\f[].
In practice, the pool replicas may be considered as binary copies of the
"master" pool set.
Data replication is not supported in \f[B]libpmemblk\f[](7) and
\f[B]libpmemlog\f[](7).
.PP
The \f[I]set\f[] file for each type of pool is a plain text file.
Lines in the file are formatted as follows:
.IP \[bu] 2
The first line of the file must be the literal string "PMEMPOOLSET"
.IP \[bu] 2
The pool parts are specified, one per line, in the format:
.RS 2
.PP
\f[I]size\f[] \f[I]pathname\f[]
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]Replica\f[] sections, if any, start with the literal string
"REPLICA".
See \f[B]REPLICAS\f[], below, for further details.
.IP \[bu] 2
Lines starting with "#" are considered comments and are ignored.
.PP
The \f[I]size\f[] must be compliant with the format specified in IEC
80000\-13, IEEE 1541 or the Metric Interchange Format.
These standards accept SI units with obligatory B \- kB, MB, GB, ...
(multiplier by 1000) suffixes, and IEC units with optional "iB" \- KiB,
MiB, GiB, ..., K, M, G, ...
\- (multiplier by 1024) suffixes.
.PP
\f[I]pathname\f[] must be an absolute pathname.
.PP
The \f[I]pathname\f[] of a part can point to a Device DAX.
Device DAX is the device\-centric analogue of Filesystem DAX.
It allows memory ranges to be allocated and mapped without need of an
intervening file system.
.PP
Pools created on Device DAX have additional options and restrictions:
.IP \[bu] 2
The \f[I]size\f[] may be set to "AUTO", in which case the size of the
device will be automatically resolved at pool creation time.
.IP \[bu] 2
To concatenate more than one Device DAX device into a single pool set,
the configured internal alignment of the devices must be 4KiB, unless
the \f[I]NOHDRS\f[] option is used in the pool set file.
.IP \[bu] 2
If a line containing the string \f[I]OPTION NOHDRS\f[] appears anywhere
after the \f[I]PMEMPOOLSET\f[] string in a pool set file, Device DAX
devices with different internal alignment can be concatenated.
.IP \[bu] 2
The \f[I]NOHDRS\f[] option concerns only local poolset files, i.e.
if one wants to create a poolset with the \f[I]NOHDRS\f[] option and
with remote replicas, one has to add this option to the local poolset
file as well as to every single remote poolset file.
.IP \[bu] 2
Using the \f[I]NOHDRS\f[] option has important implications for data
integrity checking and recoverability in case of a pool set damage.
See \f[B]pmempool_sync\f[]() API for more information about pool set
recovery.
.PP
Please see \f[B]ndctl\-create\-namespace\f[](1) for more information on
Device DAX, including how to configure desired alignment.
.PP
The minimum file size of each part of the pool set is defined as
follows:
.IP \[bu] 2
For block pools, as \f[B]PMEMBLK_MIN_PART\f[] in \f[B]<libpmemblk.h>\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
For object pools, as \f[B]PMEMOBJ_MIN_PART\f[] in
\f[B]<libpmemobj.h>\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
For log pools, as \f[B]PMEMLOG_MIN_PART\f[] in \f[B]<libpmemlog.h>\f[]
.PP
The net pool size of the pool set is equal to:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
net_pool_size\ =\ sum_over_all_parts(page_aligned_part_size\ \-\ 4KiB)\ +\ 4KiB
\f[]
.fi
.PP
where
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
page_aligned_part_size\ =\ part_size\ &\ ~(page_size\ \-\ 1)
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Note that page size is OS specific.
For more information please see \f[B]sysconf\f[](3).
.PP
The minimum net pool size of a pool set is defined as follows:
.IP \[bu] 2
For block pools, as \f[B]PMEMBLK_MIN_POOL\f[] in \f[B]<libpmemblk.h>\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
For object pools, as \f[B]PMEMOBJ_MIN_POOL\f[] in
\f[B]<libpmemobj.h>\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
For log pools, as \f[B]PMEMLOG_MIN_POOL\f[] in \f[B]<libpmemlog.h>\f[]
.PP
Here is an example "mypool.set" file:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
PMEMPOOLSET
100G\ /mountpoint0/myfile.part0
200G\ /mountpoint1/myfile.part1
400G\ /mountpoint2/myfile.part2
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The files in the set may be created by running one of the following
commands.
To create a block pool:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ pmempool\ create\ blk\ <bsize>\ mypool.set
\f[]
.fi
.PP
To create a log pool:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ pmempool\ create\ log\ mypool.set
\f[]
.fi
.SH REPLICAS
.PP
Sections defining replica sets are optional.
There may be multiple replica sections.
.PP
Local replica sections begin with a line containing only the literal
string "REPLICA", followed by one or more pool part lines as described
above.
.PP
Remote replica sections consist of the \f[I]REPLICA\f[] keyword,
followed on the same line by the address of a remote host and a relative
path to a remote pool set file:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
REPLICA\ [<user>\@]<hostname>\ [<relative\-path>/]<remote\-pool\-set\-file>
\f[]
.fi
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]hostname\f[] must be in the format recognized by the
\f[B]ssh\f[](1) remote login client
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]pathname\f[] is relative to the root config directory on the target
node \- see \f[B]librpmem\f[](3)
.PP
There are no other lines in the remote replica section \- the REPLICA
line defines a remote replica entirely.
.PP
Here is an example "myobjpool.set" file with replicas:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
PMEMPOOLSET
100G\ /mountpoint0/myfile.part0
200G\ /mountpoint1/myfile.part1
400G\ /mountpoint2/myfile.part2

#\ local\ replica
REPLICA
500G\ /mountpoint3/mymirror.part0
200G\ /mountpoint4/mymirror.part1\ 

#\ remote\ replica
REPLICA\ user\@example.com\ remote\-objpool.set
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The files in the object pool set may be created by running the following
command:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ pmempool\ create\ \-\-layout="mylayout"\ obj\ myobjpool.set
\f[]
.fi
.SH NOTES
.PP
Creation of all the parts of the pool set and the associated replica
sets can be done with the \f[B]pmemobj_create\f[](3),
\f[B]pmemblk_create\f[](3) or \f[B]pmemlog_create\f[](3) function, or by
using the \f[B]pmempool\f[](1) utility.
.PP
Restoring data from a local or remote replica can be done by using the
\f[B]pmempool\-sync\f[](1) command or the \f[B]pmempool_sync\f[]() API
from the \f[B]libpmempool\f[](3) library.
.PP
Modifications of a pool set file configuration can be done by using the
\f[B]pmempool\-transform\f[](1) command or the
\f[B]pmempool_transform\f[]() API from the \f[B]libpmempool\f[](3)
library.
.PP
When creating a pool set consisting of multiple files, or when creating
a replicated pool set, the \f[I]path\f[] argument passed to
\f[B]pmemobj_create\f[](3), \f[B]pmemblk_create\f[](3) or
\f[B]pmemlog_create\f[](3) must point to the special \f[I]set\f[] file
that defines the pool layout and the location of all the parts of the
pool set.
.PP
When opening a pool set consisting of multiple files, or when opening a
replicated pool set, the \f[I]path\f[] argument passed to
\f[B]pmemobj_open\f[](3), \f[B]pmemblk_open\f[](3) or
\f[B]pmemlog_open\f[](3) must point to the same \f[I]set\f[] file that
was used for pool set creation.
