.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]libpmemcto\f[] is a \f[I]persistent memory\f[] allocator with no
overhead imposed by run\-time flushing or transactional updates:
.IP \[bu] 2
It runs at traditional \f[B]volatile\f[] memory allocator speeds \-
there is no flushing or consistency check at run\-time.
.IP \[bu] 2
An overhead imposed only when program exits normally and have to flush
the file.
.IP \[bu] 2
The program flushes the pool contents when it exits, and then rebuilds
the pool on the next run.
.IP \[bu] 2
If the program crashes before flushing the file (or if flushing fails),
the pool is in an inconsistent state causing subsequent pool opening to
fail.
.PP
\f[B]libpmemcto\f[] provides common \f[I]malloc\-like\f[] interfaces to
persistent memory pools built on memory\-mapped files.
\f[B]libpmemcto\f[] uses the \f[B]mmap\f[](2) system call to create a
pool of persistent memory.
The library is intended for applications using \f[I]Direct Access\f[]
storage (DAX), which is memory\-addressable persistent storage that
supports load/store access without being paged via the system page
cache.
A Persistent Memory\-aware file system is typically used to provide this
type of access.
Memory\-mapping a file from a Persistent Memory\-aware file system
provides the raw memory pools, and this library supplies the more
familiar \f[I]malloc\-like\f[] interfaces on top of those pools.
.PP
Under normal usage, \f[B]libpmemcto\f[] will never print messages or
intentionally cause the process to exit.
Exceptions to this are prints caused by calls to
\f[B]pmemcto_stats_print\f[](3), or by enabling debugging as described
under \f[B]DEBUGGING AND ERROR HANDLING\f[] below.
The library uses \f[B]pthreads\f[](7) to be fully MT\-safe, but never
creates or destroys threads itself.
The library does not make use of any signals, networking, and never
calls \f[B]select\f[]() or \f[B]poll\f[]().
.PP
The system memory allocation routines like \f[B]malloc\f[]() and
\f[B]free\f[]() are used by \f[B]libpmemcto\f[] for managing a small
amount of run\-time state, but applications are allowed to override
these calls if necessary (see \f[B]pmemcto_set_funcs\f[](3)).
.PP
This library builds on the low\-level pmem support provided by
\f[B]libpmem\f[](3).
.SH MANAGING MEMORY POOLS
.PP
To use \f[B]libpmemcto\f[], a \f[I]memory pool\f[] is first created.
This is most commonly done with the \f[B]pmemcto_create\f[](3) function.
The \f[B]pmemobj_open\f[](3) function opens an existing close\-to\-open
persistence memory pool.
.PP
Once created or opened, a memory pool is represented by an opaque pool
handle, of type \f[I]PMEMctopool*\f[], which is passed to the functions
for memory allocation described in \f[B]pmemcto_malloc\f[](3),
\f[B]pmemcto_memalign\f[](3), \f[B]pmemcto_strdup\f[](3) and
\f[B]pmemcto_wcsdup\f[](3).
.SH MANAGING LIBRARY BEHAVIOR
.PP
The library entry points described in this section are less commonly
used.
These entry points expose library information or alter the default
library behavior.
.PP
The \f[B]pmemcto_check_version\f[]() function is used to see if the
installed \f[B]libpmemcto\f[] supports the version of the library API
required by an application.
The easiest way to do this is for the application to supply the
compile\-time version information, supplied by defines in
\f[B]<libpmemcto.h>\f[], like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
reason\ =\ pmemcto_check_version(PMEMCTO_MAJOR_VERSION,
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ PMEMCTO_MINOR_VERSION);
if\ (reason\ !=\ NULL)\ {
\ \ \ \ /*\ version\ check\ failed,\ reason\ string\ tells\ you\ why\ */
}
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Any mismatch in the major version number is considered a failure, but a
library with a newer minor version number will pass this check since
increasing minor versions imply backwards compatibility.
.PP
An application can also check specifically for the existence of an
interface by checking for the version where that interface was
introduced.
These versions are documented in this man page as follows: unless
otherwise specified, all interfaces described here are available in
version 1.0 of the library.
Interfaces added after version 1.0 will contain the text \f[I]introduced
in version x.y\f[] in the section of this manual describing the feature.
.PP
When the version check performed by \f[B]pmemcto_check_version\f[]() is
successful, the return value is NULL.
Otherwise the return value is a static string describing the reason for
failing the version check.
The string returned by \f[B]pmemcto_check_version\f[]() must not be
modified or freed.
.PP
The \f[B]pmemcto_set_funcs\f[]() function allows an application to
override some interfaces used internally by \f[B]libpmemcto\f[].
Passing in NULL for any of the handlers will cause the
\f[B]libpmemcto\f[] default function to be used.
The library does not make heavy use of the system malloc functions, but
it does allocate approximately 4\-8 kilobytes for each memory pool in
use.
The only functions in the malloc family used by the library are
represented by the first four arguments to \f[B]pmemcto_set_funcs\f[]().
The \f[I]print_func\f[] function is called by \f[B]libpmemcto\f[] when
the \f[B]pmemcto_stats_print\f[](3) entry point is used, or when
additional tracing is enabled in the debug version of the library as
described in the \f[B]DEBUGGING AND ERROR HANDLING\f[] section below.
The default \f[I]print_func\f[] used by the library prints to the file
specified by the \f[B]PMEMCTO_LOG_FILE\f[] environment variable, or to
\f[I]stderr\f[] if that variable is not set.
.SH DEBUGGING AND ERROR HANDLING
.PP
Two versions of \f[B]libpmemcto\f[] are typically available on a
development system.
The normal version, accessed when a program is linked using the
\f[B]\-lpmemcto\f[] option, is optimized for performance.
That version skips checks that impact performance and never logs any
trace information or performs any run\-time assertions.
If an error is detected during the call to \f[B]libpmemcto\f[] function,
an application may retrieve an error message describing the reason of
failure using the function \f[B]pmemcto_errormsg\f[](3).
.PP
A second version of \f[B]libpmemcto\f[], accessed when a program uses
the libraries under \f[B]/usr/lib/nvml_debug\f[], contains run\-time
assertions and trace points.
The typical way to access the debug version is to set the environment
variable \f[B]LD_LIBRARY_PATH\f[] to \f[B]/usr/lib/nvml_debug\f[] or
\f[B]/usr/lib64/nvml_debug\f[] depending on where the debug libraries
are installed on the system.
The trace points in the debug version of the library are enabled using
the environment variable \f[B]PMEMCTO_LOG_LEVEL\f[], which can be set to
the following values:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]0\f[] \- This is the default level when \f[B]PMEMCTO_LOG_LEVEL\f[]
is not set.
Only statistics are logged, and then only in response to a call to
\f[B]pmemcto_stats_print\f[]().
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]1\f[] \- Additional details on any errors detected are logged (in
addition to returning the \f[I]errno\f[]\-based errors as usual).
The same information may be retrieved using
\f[B]pmemcto_errormsg\f[](3).
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]2\f[] \- A trace of basic operations including allocations and
deallocations is logged.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]3\f[] \- This level enables a very verbose amount of function call
tracing in the library.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]4\f[] \- This level enables voluminous and fairly obscure tracing
information that is likely only useful to the \f[B]libpmemcto\f[]
developers.
.PP
The environment variable \f[B]PMEMCTO_LOG_FILE\f[] specifies a file name
where all logging information should be written.
If the last character in the name is "\-", the PID of the current
process will be appended to the file name when the log file is created.
If \f[B]PMEMCTO_LOG_FILE\f[] is not set, output goes to \f[I]stderr\f[].
All prints are done using the \f[I]print_func\f[] function in
\f[B]libpmemcto\f[] (see \f[B]pmemcto_set_funcs\f[](3) for details on
how to override that function).
.PP
Setting the environment variable \f[B]PMEMCTO_LOG_LEVEL\f[] has no
effect on the non\-debug version of \f[B]libpmemcto\f[].
.SH BUGS
.PP
Unlike \f[B]libpmemobj\f[](3), data replication is not supported in
\f[B]libpmemcto\f[].
Thus, it is not allowed to specify replica sections in pool set files.
.SH NOTES
.PP
Unlike the normal \f[B]malloc\f[](), which asks the system for
additional memory when it runs out, \f[B]libpmemcto\f[] allocates the
size it is told to and never attempts to grow or shrink that memory
pool.
.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
The following example creates a memory pool, allocates some memory to
contain the string "hello, world", and then frees that memory.
