\f[B]pmempool\-create\f[R] \- create a persistent memory pool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ pmempool create [<options>] [<type>] [<bsize>] <file>
\f[R]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]pmempool\f[R] invoked with \f[I]create\f[R] command creates a
pool file of specified type.
Depending on a pool type it is possible to provide more properties of
pool.
.PP
Valid pool types are: \f[B]blk\f[R], \f[B]log\f[R] and \f[B]obj\f[R]
which stands for \f[I]pmemblk\f[R], \f[I]pmemlog\f[R] and
\f[I]pmemobj\f[R] pools respectively.
By default the pool file is created with \f[I]minimum\f[R] allowed size
for specified pool type.
The minimum sizes for \f[B]blk\f[R], \f[B]log\f[R] and \f[B]obj\f[R]
pool types are \f[B]PMEMBLK_MIN_POOL\f[R], \f[B]PMEMLOG_MIN_POOL\f[R]
and \f[B]PMEMOBJ_MIN_POOL\f[R] respectively.
See \f[B]libpmemblk\f[R](7), \f[B]libpmemlog\f[R](7) and
\f[B]libpmemobj\f[R](7) for details.
.PP
For \f[I]pmemblk\f[R] pool type block size \f[I]<bsize>\f[R] is a
required argument.
.PP
In order to set custom size of pool use \f[B]\-s\f[R] option, or use
\f[B]\-M\f[R] option to create a pool of maximum available size on
underlying file system.
.PP
The \f[I]size\f[R] argument may be passed in format that permits only
the upper\-case character for byte \- B as specified in IEC 80000\-13,
IEEE 1541 and the Metric Interchange Format.
Standards accept SI units with obligatory B \- kB, MB, GB, \&... which
means multiplier by 1000 and IEC units with optional \[lq]iB\[rq] \-
KiB, MiB, GiB, \&..., K, M, G, \&... \- which means multiplier by 1024.
.SS Available options:
.PP
\f[C]\-s, \-\-size <size>\f[R]
.PP
Size of pool file.
.PP
\f[C]\-M, \-\-max\-size\f[R]
.PP
Set size of pool to available space of underlying file system.
.PP
\f[C]\-m, \-\-mode <octal>\f[R]
.PP
Set permissions to (the default is 0664) when creating the files.
If the file already exist the permissions are not changed.
.PP
\f[C]\-i, \-\-inherit <file>\f[R]
.PP
Create a new pool of the same size and other properties as
\f[I]<file>\f[R].
.PP
\f[C]\-b, \-\-clear\-bad\-blocks\f[R]
.PP
Clear bad blocks in existing files.
.PP
\f[C]\-f, \-\-force\f[R]
.PP
Remove the pool before creating.
.PP
\f[C]\-v, \-\-verbose\f[R]
.PP
Increase verbosity level.
.PP
\f[C]\-h, \-\-help\f[R]
.PP
Display help message and exit.
.SS Options for PMEMBLK:
.PP
By default when creating a pmem \f[B]blk\f[R] pool, the \f[B]BTT\f[R]
layout is \f[I]not\f[R] written until the first \f[I]write
operation\f[R] of block entry is performed.
Using \f[B]\-w\f[R] option you can force writing the \f[B]BTT\f[R]
layout by writing zero data to specified block number.
By default the \f[I]write operation\f[R] is performed to block number 0.
Please refer to \f[B]libpmemblk\f[R](7) for details.
.PP
\f[C]\-w, \-\-write\-layout\f[R]
.PP
Force writing the \f[B]BTT\f[R] layout by performing \f[I]write
operation\f[R] to block number zero.
.SS Options for PMEMOBJ:
.PP
By default when creating a pmem \f[B]obj\f[R] pool, the layout name
provided to the \f[B]libpmemobj\f[R] library is an empty string.
Please refer to \f[B]libpmemobj\f[R](7) for details.
.PP
\f[C]\-l, \-\-layout <layout>\f[R]
.PP
Layout name of the \f[B]pmemobj\f[R] pool.
