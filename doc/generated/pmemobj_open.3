.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
To use the pmem\-resident transactional object store provided by
\f[B]libpmemobj\f[](7), a \f[I]memory pool\f[] must first be created
with the \f[B]pmemobj_create\f[]() function described below.
Existing pools may be opened with the \f[B]pmemobj_open\f[]() function.
.PP
None of the three functions described below are thread\-safe with
respect to any other \f[B]libpmemobj\f[](7) function.
In other words, when creating, opening or deleting a pool, nothing else
in the library can happen in parallel, and therefore these functions
should be called from the main thread.
.PP
Once created, the memory pool is represented by an opaque handle, of
type \f[I]PMEMobjpool*\f[], which is passed to most of the other
\f[B]libpmemobj\f[](7) functions.
Internally, \f[B]libpmemobj\f[](7) will use either
\f[B]pmem_persist\f[](3) or \f[B]msync\f[](2) when it needs to flush
changes, depending on whether the memory pool appears to be persistent
memory or a regular file (see the \f[B]pmem_is_pmem\f[](3) function in
\f[B]libpmem\f[](7) for more information).
There is no need for applications to flush changes directly when using
the object memory API provided by \f[B]libpmemobj\f[](7).
.PP
The \f[B]pmemobj_create\f[]() function creates a transactional object
store with the given total \f[I]poolsize\f[].
\f[I]path\f[] specifies the name of the memory pool file to be created.
\f[I]layout\f[] specifies the application's layout type in the form of a
string.
The layout name is not interpreted by \f[B]libpmemobj\f[](7), but may be
used as a check when \f[B]pmemobj_open\f[]() is called.
The layout name, including the terminating null byte (`\\0'), cannot be
longer than \f[B]PMEMOBJ_MAX_LAYOUT\f[] as defined in
\f[B]<libpmemobj.h>\f[].
A NULL \f[I]layout\f[] is equivalent to using an empty string as a
layout name.
\f[I]mode\f[] specifies the permissions to use when creating the file,
as described by \f[B]creat\f[](2).
The memory pool file is fully allocated to the size \f[I]poolsize\f[]
using \f[B]posix_fallocate\f[](3).
The caller may choose to take responsibility for creating the memory
pool file by creating it before calling \f[B]pmemobj_create\f[](), and
then specifying \f[I]poolsize\f[] as zero.
In this case \f[B]pmemobj_create\f[]() will take the pool size from the
size of the existing file and will verify that the file appears to be
empty by searching for any non\-zero data in the pool header at the
beginning of the file.
The minimum net pool size allowed by the library for a local
transactional object store is defined in \f[B]<libpmemobj.h>\f[] as
\f[B]PMEMOBJ_MIN_POOL\f[].
For remote replicas the minimum file size is defined in
\f[B]<librpmem.h>\f[] as \f[B]RPMEM_MIN_PART\f[].
.PP
Depending on the configuration of the system, the available
non\-volatile memory space may be divided into multiple memory devices.
In such case, the maximum size of the pmemobj memory pool could be
limited by the capacity of a single memory device.
\f[B]libpmemobj\f[](7) allows building persistent memory resident object
store spanning multiple memory devices by creation of persistent memory
pools consisting of multiple files, where each part of such a \f[I]pool
set\f[] may be stored on a different memory device or pmem\-aware
filesystem.
.PP
Creation of all the parts of the pool set can be done with
\f[B]pmemobj_create\f[](); however, the recommended method for creating
pool sets is with the \f[B]pmempool\f[](1) utility.
.PP
When creating a pool set consisting of multiple files, the \f[I]path\f[]
argument passed to \f[B]pmemobj_create\f[]() must point to the special
\f[I]set\f[] file that defines the pool layout and the location of all
the parts of the pool set.
The \f[I]poolsize\f[] argument must be 0.
The meaning of the \f[I]layout\f[] and \f[I]mode\f[] arguments does not
change, except that the same \f[I]mode\f[] is used for creation of all
the parts of the pool set.
.PP
The \f[I]set\f[] file is a plain text file, the structure of which is
described in \f[B]poolset\f[](5).
.PP
The \f[B]pmemobj_open\f[]() function opens an existing object store
memory pool.
Similar to \f[B]pmemobj_create\f[](), \f[I]path\f[] must identify either
an existing obj memory pool file, or the \f[I]set\f[] file used to
create a pool set.
If \f[I]layout\f[] is non\-NULL, it is compared to the layout name
provided to \f[B]pmemobj_create\f[]() when the pool was first created.
This can be used to verify that the layout of the pool matches what was
expected.
The application must have permission to open the file and memory map it
with read/write permissions.
.PP
Be aware that if the pool contains bad blocks inside, opening can be
aborted by the SIGBUS signal, because currently the pool is not checked
against bad blocks during opening.
It can be turned on by setting the CHECK_BAD_BLOCKS compat feature.
For details see description of this feature in
\f[B]pmempool\-feature\f[](1).
.PP
The \f[B]pmemobj_close\f[]() function closes the memory pool indicated
by \f[I]pop\f[] and deletes the memory pool handle.
The object store itself lives on in the file that contains it and may be
re\-opened at a later time using \f[B]pmemobj_open\f[]() as described
above.
.PP
The \f[B]pmemobj_check\f[]() function performs a consistency check of
the file indicated by \f[I]path\f[].
\f[B]pmemobj_check\f[]() opens the given \f[I]path\f[] read\-only so it
never makes any changes to the file.
This function is not supported on Device DAX.
.PP
The \f[B]pmemobj_set_user_data\f[]() function associates custom volatile
state, represented by pointer \f[I]data\f[], with the given pool
\f[I]pop\f[].
This state can later be retrieved using \f[B]pmemobj_get_user_data\f[]()
function.
This state does not survive pool close.
If \f[B]pmemobj_set_user_data\f[]() was not called for a given pool,
\f[B]pmemobj_get_user_data\f[]() will return NULL.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
The \f[B]pmemobj_create\f[]() function returns a memory pool handle to
be used with most of the functions in \f[B]libpmemobj\f[](7).
On error it returns NULL and sets \f[I]errno\f[] appropriately.
.PP
The \f[B]pmemobj_open\f[]() function returns a memory pool handle to be
used with most of the functions in \f[B]libpmemobj\f[](7).
If an error prevents the pool from being opened, or if the given
\f[I]layout\f[] does not match the pool's layout,
\f[B]pmemobj_open\f[]() returns NULL and sets \f[I]errno\f[]
appropriately.
.PP
The \f[B]pmemobj_close\f[]() function returns no value.
.PP
The \f[B]pmemobj_check\f[]() function returns 1 if the memory pool is
found to be consistent.
Any inconsistencies found will cause \f[B]pmemobj_check\f[]() to return
0, in which case the use of the file with \f[B]libpmemobj\f[](7) will
result in undefined behavior.
The debug version of \f[B]libpmemobj\f[](7) will provide additional
details on inconsistencies when \f[B]PMEMOBJ_LOG_LEVEL\f[] is at least
1, as described in the \f[B]DEBUGGING AND ERROR HANDLING\f[] section in
\f[B]libpmemobj\f[](7).
\f[B]pmemobj_check\f[]() returns \-1 and sets \f[I]errno\f[] if it
cannot perform the consistency check due to other errors.
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
Not all file systems support \f[B]posix_fallocate\f[](3).
\f[B]pmemobj_create\f[]() will fail if the underlying file system does
not support \f[B]posix_fallocate\f[](3).
