.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
To use the pmem\-resident transactional object store provided by
\f[B]libpmemobj\f[](7), a \f[I]memory pool\f[] is first created.
This is done with the \f[B]pmemobj_create\f[]() function described in
this section.
The other functions described in this section then operate on the
resulting memory pool.
.PP
Additionally, none of the three functions described below are
thread\-safe with respect to any other \f[B]libpmemobj\f[] functions.
In other words, when creating, opening or deleting a pool, nothing else
in the library can happen in parallel.
.PP
Once created, the memory pool is represented by an opaque handle, of
type \f[I]PMEMobjpool*\f[], which is passed to most of the other
functions in this section.
Internally, \f[B]libpmemobj\f[] will use either \f[B]pmem_persist\f[](3)
or \f[B]msync\f[](2) when it needs to flush changes, depending on
whether the memory pool appears to be persistent memory or a regular
file (see the \f[B]pmem_is_pmem\f[](3) function in \f[B]libpmem\f[](7)
for more information).
There is no need for applications to flush changes directly when using
the obj memory API provided by \f[B]libpmemobj\f[].
.PP
The \f[B]pmemobj_create\f[]() function creates a transactional object
store with the given total \f[I]poolsize\f[].
\f[I]path\f[] specifies the name of the memory pool file to be created.
\f[I]layout\f[] specifies the application\[aq]s layout type in the form
of a string.
The layout name is not interpreted by \f[B]libpmemobj\f[], but may be
used as a check when \f[B]pmemobj_open\f[]() is called.
The layout name, including the terminating null byte (\[aq]\[aq]),
cannot be longer than \f[B]PMEMOBJ_MAX_LAYOUT\f[] as defined in
\f[B]<libpmemobj.h>\f[].
It is allowed to pass NULL as \f[I]layout\f[], which is equivalent for
using an empty string as a layout name.
\f[I]mode\f[] specifies the permissions to use when creating the file as
described by \f[B]creat\f[](2).
The memory pool file is fully allocated to the size \f[I]poolsize\f[]
using \f[B]posix_fallocate\f[](3).
The caller may choose to take responsibility for creating the memory
pool file by creating it before calling \f[B]pmemobj_create\f[]() and
then specifying \f[I]poolsize\f[] as zero.
In this case \f[B]pmemobj_create\f[]() will take the pool size from the
size of the existing file and will verify that the file appears to be
empty by searching for any non\-zero data in the pool header at the
beginning of the file.
The minimum net pool size allowed by the library for a local
transactional object store is defined in \f[B]<libpmemobj.h>\f[] as
\f[B]PMEMOBJ_MIN_POOL\f[].
For remote replicas the minimum file size is defined in
\f[B]<librpmem.h>\f[] as \f[B]RPMEM_MIN_PART\f[].
.PP
The \f[B]pmemobj_open\f[]() function opens an existing object store
memory pool, \f[I]path\f[] must be an existing file containing a pmemobj
memory pool as created by \f[B]pmemobj_create\f[]().
If \f[I]layout\f[] is non\-NULL, it is compared to the layout name
provided to \f[B]pmemobj_create\f[]() when the pool was first created.
This can be used to verify the layout of the pool matches what was
expected.
The application must have permission to open the file and memory map it
with read/write permissions.
.PP
The \f[B]pmemobj_close\f[]() function closes the memory pool indicated
by \f[I]pop\f[] and deletes the memory pool handle.
The object store itself lives on in the file that contains it and may be
re\-opened at a later time using \f[B]pmemobj_open\f[]() as described
above.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
The \f[B]pmemobj_create\f[]() function returns memory pool handle used
with most of the functions in \f[B]libpmemobj\f[](7).
On error it returns NULL and sets \f[I]errno\f[] appropriately.
.PP
The \f[B]pmemobj_open\f[]() function returns a memory pool handle used
with most of the functions in in \f[B]libpmemobj\f[](7).
If an error prevents the pool from being opened, or if the given
\f[I]layout\f[] does not match the pool\[aq]s layout,
\f[B]pmemobj_open\f[]() returns NULL and sets \f[I]errno\f[]
appropriately.
.PP
The \f[B]pmemobj_close\f[]() function returns no value.
