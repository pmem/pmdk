.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]pmemlog_ctl_get\f[](), \f[B]pmemlog_ctl_set\f[]() and
\f[B]pmemlog_ctl_exec\f[]() functions provide a uniform interface for
querying and modifying the internal behavior of \f[B]libpmemlog\f[](7)
through the control (CTL) namespace.
.PP
See more in \f[B]pmem_ctl\f[](5) man page.
.SH CTL NAMESPACE
.PP
prefault.at_create | rw | global | int | int | \- | boolean
.PP
If set, every page of the pool will be touched and written to when the
pool is created, in order to trigger page allocation and minimize the
performance impact of pagefaults.
Affects only the \f[B]pmemlog_create\f[]() function.
.PP
Always returns 0.
.PP
prefault.at_open | rw | global | int | int | \- | boolean
.PP
If set, every page of the pool will be touched and written to when the
pool is opened, in order to trigger page allocation and minimize the
performance impact of pagefaults.
Affects only the \f[B]pmemlog_open\f[]() function.
.PP
Always returns 0.
.PP
sds.at_create | rw | global | int | int | \- | boolean
.PP
If set, force\-enables or force\-disables SDS feature during pool
creation.
Affects only the \f[B]pmemlog_create\f[]() function.
See \f[B]pmempool_feature_query\f[](3) for informations about SDS
(SHUTDOWN_STATE) feature.
.PP
Always returns 0.
.SH CTL EXTERNAL CONFIGURATION
.PP
In addition to direct function call, each write entry point can also be
set using two alternative methods.
.PP
The first method is to load a configuration directly from the
\f[B]PMEMLOG_CONF\f[] environment variable.
.PP
The second method of loading an external configuration is to set the
\f[B]PMEMLOG_CONF_FILE\f[] environment variable to point to a file that
contains a sequence of ctl queries.
.PP
See more in \f[B]pmem_ctl\f[](5) man page.
