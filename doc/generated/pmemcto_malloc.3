void\ *pmemcto_malloc(PMEMctopool\ *pcp,\ size_t\ size);
void\ pmemcto_free(PMEMctopool\ *pcp,\ void\ *ptr);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]pmemcto_malloc\f[]() function provides the same semantics as
\f[B]malloc\f[](3), but operates on the memory pool \f[I]pcp\f[] instead
of the process heap supplied by the system.
It allocates \f[I]size\f[] bytes and returns a pointer to the allocated
memory.
\f[I]The memory is not initialized\f[].
If \f[I]size\f[] is 0, then \f[B]pmemcto_malloc\f[]() returns either
NULL, or a unique pointer value that can later be successfully passed to
\f[B]pmemcto_free\f[]().
.PP
The \f[B]pmemcto_free\f[]() function provides the same semantics as
\f[B]free\f[](3), but operates on the memory pool \f[I]pcp\f[] instead
of the process heap supplied by the system.
It frees the memory space pointed to by \f[I]ptr\f[], which must have
been returned by a previous call to \f[B]pmemcto_malloc\f[](),
\f[B]pmemcto_calloc\f[]() or \f[B]pmemcto_realloc\f[]() for \f[I]the
same pool of memory\f[].
Undefined behavior occurs if frees do not correspond to allocated memory
from the same memory pool.
If \f[I]ptr\f[] is NULL, no operation is performed.
.PP
The \f[B]pmemcto_calloc\f[]() function provides the same semantics as
\f[B]calloc\f[](3), but operates on the memory pool \f[I]pcp\f[] instead
of the process heap supplied by the system.
It allocates memory for an array of \f[I]nmemb\f[] elements of
\f[I]size\f[] bytes each and returns a pointer to the allocated memory.
The memory is set to zero.
If \f[I]nmemb\f[] or \f[I]size\f[] is 0, then \f[B]pmemcto_calloc\f[]()
returns either NULL, or a unique pointer value that can later be
successfully passed to \f[B]pmemcto_free\f[]().
.PP
The \f[B]pmemcto_realloc\f[]() function provides the same semantics as
\f[B]realloc\f[](3), but operates on the memory pool \f[I]pcp\f[]
instead of the process heap supplied by the system.
It changes the size of the memory block pointed to by \f[I]ptr\f[] to
\f[I]size\f[] bytes.
The contents will be unchanged in the range from the start of the region
up to the minimum of the old and new sizes.
If the new size is larger than the old size, the added memory will
\f[I]not\f[] be initialized.
If \f[I]ptr\f[] is NULL, then the call is equivalent to
\f[I]pmemcto_malloc(pcp, size)\f[], for all values of \f[I]size\f[]; if
\f[I]size\f[] is equal to zero and \f[I]ptr\f[] is not NULL, then the
call is equivalent to \f[I]pmemcto_free(pcp, ptr)\f[].
Unless \f[I]ptr\f[] is NULL, it must have been returned by an earlier
call to \f[B]pmemcto_malloc\f[](), \f[B]pmemcto_calloc\f[]() or
\f[B]pmemcto_realloc\f[]().
If the area pointed to was moved, a \f[I]pmemcto_free(pcp, ptr)\f[] is
done.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
The \f[B]pmemcto_malloc\f[]() and \f[B]pmemcto_calloc\f[]() functions
return a pointer to the allocated memory.
If the allocation request cannot be satisfied, a NULL pointer is
returned and \f[I]errno\f[] is set appropriately.
.PP
The \f[B]pmemcto_free\f[]() function returns no value.
.PP
The \f[B]pmemcto_realloc\f[]() function returns a pointer to the newly
allocated memory, or NULL if it is unable to satisfy the allocation
request.
If \f[I]size\f[] was equal to 0, either NULL or a pointer suitable to be
passed to \f[B]pmemcto_free\f[]() is returned.
If \f[B]pmemcto_realloc\f[]() fails the original block is left
untouched; it is not freed or moved.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
\f[B]ENOMEM\f[] Insufficient memory available to satisfy allocation
request.
.SH NOTES
.PP
Unlike the normal \f[B]malloc\f[](), which asks the system for
additional memory when it runs out, \f[B]libpmemcto\f[] allocates the
size it is told to and never attempts to grow or shrink that memory
pool.
.SH ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
.PP
\f[B]libpmemcto\f[] depends on jemalloc, written by Jason Evans, to do
the heavy lifting of managing dynamic memory allocation.
See: <http://www.canonware.com/jemalloc>
.PP
\f[B]libpmemcto\f[] builds on the persistent memory programming model
recommended by the SNIA NVM Programming Technical Work Group:
