\f[B]pmemblk_read\f[](3), \f[B]pmemblk_set_zero\f[](3)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]libpmemblk\f[] provides an array of blocks in \f[I]persistent
memory\f[] (pmem) such that updates to a single block are atomic.
This library is intended for applications using direct access storage
(DAX), which is storage that supports load/store access without paging
blocks from a block storage device.
Some types of \f[I]non\-volatile memory DIMMs\f[] (NVDIMMs) provide this
type of byte addressable access to storage.
A \f[I]persistent memory aware file system\f[] is typically used to
expose the direct access to applications.
Memory mapping a file from this type of file system results in the
load/store, non\-paged access to pmem.
\f[B]libpmemblk\f[] builds on this type of memory mapped file.
.PP
This library is for applications that need a potentially large array of
blocks, all the same size, where any given block is updated atomically
(the update cannot be \f[I]torn\f[] by program interruption such as
power failures).
This library builds on the low\-level pmem support provided by
\f[B]libpmem\f[](3), handling the transactional update of the blocks,
flushing to persistence, and recovery for the application.
\f[B]libpmemblk\f[] is one of a collection of persistent memory
libraries available, the others are:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]libpmemobj\f[](7), a general use persistent memory API, providing
memory allocation and transactional operations on variable\-sized
objects.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]libpmemlog\f[](7), providing a pmem\-resident log file.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]libpmemcto\f[](7), providing close\-to\-open persistence.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]libpmem\f[](7), low\-level persistent memory support.
.PP
Under normal usage, \f[B]libpmemblk\f[] will never print messages or
intentionally cause the process to exit.
The only exception to this is the debugging information, when enabled,
as described under \f[B]DEBUGGING AND ERROR HANDLING\f[] below.
.PP
To use the atomic block arrays supplied by \f[B]libpmemblk\f[], a
\f[I]memory pool\f[] is first created using the
\f[B]pmemblk_create\f[]() function described in
\f[B]pmemblk_create\f[](3).
The other \f[B]libpmemblk\f[] functions operate on the resulting block
memory pool using the opaque handle, of type \f[I]PMEMblkpool*\f[], that
is returned by \f[B]pmemblk_create\f[]() or \f[B]pmemblk_open\f[]().
Internally, \f[B]libpmemblk\f[] will use either \f[B]pmem_persist\f[](3)
or \f[B]msync\f[](2) when it needs to flush changes, depending on
whether the memory pool appears to be persistent memory or a regular
file (see the \f[B]pmem_is_pmem\f[](3) function in \f[B]libpmem\f[](7)
for more information).
There is no need for applications to flush changes directly when using
the block memory API provided by \f[B]libpmemblk\f[].
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
\f[B]libpmemblk\f[] relies on the library destructor being called from
the main thread.
For this reason, all functions that might trigger destruction (e.g.
\f[B]dlclose\f[](3)) should be called in the main thread.
Otherwise some of the resources associated with that thread might not be
cleaned up properly.
.SH LIBRARY API VERSIONING
.PP
This section describes how the library API is versioned, allowing
applications to work with an evolving API.
.PP
The \f[B]pmemblk_check_version\f[]() function is used to determine
whether the installed \f[B]libpmemblk\f[] supports the version of the
library API required by an application.
The easiest way to do this is for the application to supply the
compile\-time version information, supplied by defines in
\f[B]<ibpmemblk.h>\f[], like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
reason\ =\ pmemblk_check_version(PMEMBLK_MAJOR_VERSION,
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ PMEMBLK_MINOR_VERSION);
if\ (reason\ !=\ NULL)\ {
\ \ \ \ /*\ version\ check\ failed,\ reason\ string\ tells\ you\ why\ */
}
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Any mismatch in the major version number is considered a failure, but a
library with a newer minor version number will pass this check since
increasing minor versions imply backwards compatibility.
.PP
An application can also check specifically for the existence of an
interface by checking for the version where that interface was
introduced.
These versions are documented in this man page as follows: unless
otherwise specified, all interfaces described here are available in
version 1.0 of the library.
Interfaces added after version 1.0 will contain the text \f[I]introduced
in version x.y\f[] in the section of this manual describing the feature.
.PP
When the version check performed by \f[B]pmemblk_check_version\f[]() is
successful, the return value is NULL.
Otherwise the return value is a static string describing the reason for
failing the version check.
The string returned by \f[B]pmemblk_check_version\f[]() must not be
modified or freed.
.SH MANAGING LIBRARY BEHAVIOR
.PP
The \f[B]pmemblk_set_funcs\f[]() function allows an application to
override memory allocation calls used internally by \f[B]libpmemblk\f[].
Passing in NULL for any of the handlers will cause the
\f[B]libpmemblk\f[] default function to be used.
The library does not make heavy use of the system malloc functions, but
it does allocate approximately 4\-8 kilobytes for each memory pool in
use.
.SH DEBUGGING AND ERROR HANDLING
.PP
The \f[B]pmemblk_errormsg\f[]() function returns a pointer to a static
buffer containing the last error message logged for the current thread.
If \f[I]errno\f[] was set, the error message may include a description
of the corresponding error code, as returned by \f[B]strerror\f[](3).
The error message buffer is thread\-local; errors encountered in one
thread do not affect its value in other threads.
The buffer is never cleared by any library function; its content is
significant only when the return value of the immediately preceding call
to a \f[B]libpmemblk\f[] function indicated an error, or if
\f[I]errno\f[] was set.
The application must not modify or free the error message string, but it
may be modified by subsequent calls to other library functions.
.PP
Two versions of \f[B]libpmemblk\f[] are typically available on a
development system.
The normal version, accessed when a program is linked using the
\f[B]\-lpmemblk\f[] option, is optimized for performance.
That version skips checks that impact performance and never logs any
trace information or performs any run\-time assertions.
If an error is detected in a call to \f[B]libpmemblk\f[], the error
message describing the failure may be retrieved with
\f[B]pmemblk_errormsg\f[]() as described above.
.PP
A second version of \f[B]libpmemblk\f[], accessed when a program uses
the libraries under \f[B]/usr/lib/pmdk_debug\f[], contains run\-time
assertions and trace points.
The typical way to access the debug version is to set the
\f[B]LD_LIBRARY_PATH\f[] environment variable to
\f[B]/usr/lib/pmdk_debug\f[] or \f[B]/usr/lib64/pmdk_debug\f[], as
appropriate.
Debugging output is controlled using the following environment
variables.
These variables have no effect on the non\-debug version of the library.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEMBLK_LOG_LEVEL\f[]
.PP
The value of \f[B]PMEMBLK_LOG_LEVEL\f[] enables trace points in the
debug version of the library, as follows:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]0\f[] \- This is the default level when \f[B]PMEMBLK_LOG_LEVEL\f[]
is not set.
No log messages are emitted at this level.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]1\f[] \- Additional details on any errors detected are logged, in
addition to returning the \f[I]errno\f[]\-based errors as usual.
The same information may be retrieved using \f[B]pmemblk_errormsg\f[]().
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]2\f[] \- A trace of basic operations is logged.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]3\f[] \- Enables a very verbose amount of function call tracing in
the library.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]4\f[] \- Enables voluminous and fairly obscure tracing information
that is likely only useful to the \f[B]libpmemblk\f[] developers.
.PP
Unless \f[B]PMEMBLK_LOG_FILE\f[] is set, debugging output is written to
\f[I]stderr\f[].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEMBLK_LOG_FILE\f[]
.PP
Specifies the name of a file where all logging information should be
written.
If the last character in the name is \[lq]\-\[rq], the \f[I]PID\f[] of
the current process will be appended to the file name when the log file
is created.
If \f[B]PMEMBLK_LOG_FILE\f[] is not set, the logging output is written
to \f[I]stderr\f[].
.PP
See also \f[B]libpmem\f[](7) for information on other environment
variables that may affect \f[B]libpmemblk\f[] behavior.

.SH BUGS
.PP
Unlike \f[B]libpmemobj\f[](7), data replication is not supported in
\f[B]libpmemblk\f[].
Thus, specifying replica sections in pool set files is not allowed.
