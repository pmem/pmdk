.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]pmem_memmove\f[](), \f[B]pmem_memcpy\f[]() and
\f[B]pmem_memset\f[]() functions provide the same memory copying as
their namesakes \f[B]memmove\f[](3), \f[B]memcpy\f[](3) and
\f[B]memset\f[](3), and ensure that the result has been flushed to
persistence before returning (unless \f[B]PMEM_F_MEM_NOFLUSH\f[] flag
was used).
.PP
For example, the following code is functionally equivalent to
\f[B]pmem_memmove\f[]() (with flags equal to 0):
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\ \ \ \ memmove(dest,\ src,\ len);
\ \ \ \ pmem_persist(dest,\ len);
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Calling \f[B]pmem_memmove\f[]() may out\-perform the above code, because
\f[B]libpmem\f[](7) implementation may take advantage of the fact that
\f[I]pmemdest\f[] is persistent memory and use instructions such as
\f[I]non\-temporal\f[] stores to avoid the need to flush processor
caches.
.RS
.PP
WARNING: Using these functions where \f[B]pmem_is_pmem\f[](3) returns
false may not do anything useful.
Use libc functions in that case.
.RE
.PP
Unlike libc implementation, \f[B]libpmem\f[] functions guarantee that if
destination buffer address and length are 8 byte aligned then all stores
will be performed using at least 8 byte store instructions.
This means that a series of 8 byte stores followed by
\f[B]pmem_persist\f[](3) can be safely replaced by a single call to one
of the above functions.
.PP
The \f[I]flags\f[] argument of all of the above functions has the same
meaning.
It can be 0 or a bitwise OR of one or more of the following flags:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEM_F_MEM_NODRAIN\f[] \- modifies the behavior to skip the final
\f[B]pmem_drain\f[]() step.
This allows applications to optimize cases where several ranges are
being copied to persistent memory, followed by a single call to
\f[B]pmem_drain\f[]().
The following example illustrates how this flag might be used to avoid
multiple calls to \f[B]pmem_drain\f[]() when copying several ranges of
memory to pmem:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/*\ ...\ write\ several\ ranges\ to\ pmem\ ...\ */
pmem_memcpy(pmemdest1,\ src1,\ len1,\ PMEM_F_MEM_NODRAIN);
pmem_memcpy(pmemdest2,\ src2,\ len2,\ PMEM_F_MEM_NODRAIN);

/*\ ...\ */

/*\ wait\ for\ any\ pmem\ stores\ to\ drain\ from\ HW\ buffers\ */
pmem_drain();
\f[]
.fi
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEM_F_MEM_NOFLUSH\f[] \- Don't flush anything.
This implies \f[B]PMEM_F_MEM_NODRAIN\f[].
Using this flag only makes sense when it's followed by any function that
flushes data.
.PP
The remaining flags say \f[I]how\f[] the operation should be done, and
are merely hints.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEM_F_MEM_NONTEMPORAL\f[] \- Use non\-temporal instructions.
This flag is mutually exclusive with \f[B]PMEM_F_MEM_TEMPORAL\f[].
On x86_64 this flag is mutually exclusive with
\f[B]PMEM_F_MEM_NOFLUSH\f[].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEM_F_MEM_TEMPORAL\f[] \- Use temporal instructions.
This flag is mutually exclusive with \f[B]PMEM_F_MEM_NONTEMPORAL\f[].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEM_F_MEM_WC\f[] \- Use write combining mode.
This flag is mutually exclusive with \f[B]PMEM_F_MEM_WB\f[].
On x86_64 this is an alias for \f[B]PMEM_F_MEM_NONTEMPORAL\f[].
On x86_64 this flag is mutually exclusive with
\f[B]PMEM_F_MEM_NOFLUSH\f[].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEM_F_MEM_WB\f[] \- Use write back mode.
This flag is mutually exclusive with \f[B]PMEM_F_MEM_WC\f[].
On x86_64 this is an alias for \f[B]PMEM_F_MEM_TEMPORAL\f[].
.PP
Using an invalid combination of flags has undefined behavior.
.PP
Without any of the above flags \f[B]libpmem\f[] will try to guess the
best strategy based on size.
See \f[B]PMEM_MOVNT_THRESHOLD\f[] description in \f[B]libpmem\f[](7) for
details.

\f[B]pmem_memmove_persist\f[]() is an alias for \f[B]pmem_memmove\f[]()

with flags equal to \f[B]PMEM_F_MEM_NODRAIN\f[].

\f[B]pmem_memcpy_nodrain\f[]() is an alias for \f[B]pmem_memcpy\f[]()

\f[B]pmem_memset_nodrain\f[]() is an alias for \f[B]pmem_memset\f[]()
with flags equal to \f[B]PMEM_F_MEM_NODRAIN\f[].
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
All of the above functions return address of the destination buffer.
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
After calling any of the functions with \f[B]PMEM_F_MEM_NODRAIN\f[] flag
you should not expect memory to be visible to other threads before
calling \f[B]pmem_drain\f[](3) or any of the \f[I]_persist\f[]
functions.
This is because on x86_64 those functions may use non\-temporal store
instructions, which are weakly ordered.
See \[lq]Intel 64 and IA\-32 Architectures Software Developer's
Manual\[rq], Volume 1, \[lq]Caching of Temporal vs.\ Non\-Temporal
Data\[rq] section for details.
