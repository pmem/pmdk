# NAME #

_UW(pmempool_sync), _UW(pmempool_transform) -- pool set synchronization and transformation


# SYNOPSIS #

```c
#include <libpmempool.h>

_UWFUNCR1(int, pmempool_sync, *poolset_file,=q=
	unsigned flags=e=, =q= (EXPERIMENTAL)=e=)
_UWFUNCR12(int, pmempool_transform, *poolset_file_src,
	*poolset_file_dst, unsigned flags, =q= (EXPERIMENTAL)=e=)
```

# DESCRIPTION #

The _UW(pmempool_sync) function synchronizes data between replicas within
a pool set.

_UW(pmempool_sync) accepts two arguments:

* *poolset_file* - a path to a pool set file,

* *flags* - a combination of flags (ORed) which modify how synchronization
is performed.

>NOTE: Only the pool set file used to create the pool should be used
for syncing the pool.

The following flags are available:

* **PMEMPOOL_DRY_RUN** - do not apply changes, only check for viability of
synchronization.

_UW(pmempool_sync) checks that the metadata of all replicas in
a pool set is consistent, i.e. all parts are healthy, and if any of them is
not, the corrupted or missing parts are recreated and filled with data from
one of the healthy replicas.

_UW(pmempool_transform) modifies the internal structure of a
pool set. It supports the following operations:

* adding one or more replicas,

* removing one or more replicas,

* reordering of replicas.


_UW(pmempool_transform) accepts three arguments:

* *poolset_file_src* - pathname of the pool *set* file for the source
pool set to be changed,

* *poolset_file_dst* - pathname of the pool *set* file that defines the new
structure of the pool set,

* *flags* - a combination of flags (ORed) which modify how synchronization
is performed.

The following flags are available:

* **PMEMPOOL_DRY_RUN** - do not apply changes, only check for viability of
synchronization.

When adding or deleting replicas, the two pool set files can differ only in the
definitions of replicas which are to be added or deleted. One cannot add and
remove replicas in the same step. Only one of these operations can be performed
at a time. Reordering replicas can be combined with either of them.
Also, to add a replica it is necessary for its effective size to match or
exceed the pool size. Otherwise the whole operation fails and no changes are
applied. The effective size of a replica is the sum of sizes of all its part
files decreased by 4096 bytes per each part file. The 4096 bytes of each part
file is utilized for storing internal metadata of the pool part files.


# RETURN VALUE #

_UW(pmempool_sync) and _UW(pmempool_transform) return 0 on success.
Otherwise, they return -1 and set *errno* appropriately.


# NOTES #


The _UW(pmempool_sync) API is experimental and it may change in future
versions of the library.

The _UW(pmempool_transform) API is experimental and it may change in future
versions of the library.
