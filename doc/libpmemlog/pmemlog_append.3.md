# NAME #

**pmemlog_append**(), **pmemlog_appendv**() - append bytes to the persistent
memory resident log file

# SYNOPSIS #

```c
#include <libpmemlog.h>

int pmemlog_append(PMEMlogpool *plp, const void *buf, size_t count);
int pmemlog_appendv(PMEMlogpool *plp, const struct iovec *iov, int iovcnt);
```

# DESCRIPTION #

The **pmemlog_append**() function appends *count* bytes from *buf*
to the current write offset in the log memory pool *plp*.
Calling this function is analogous to appending to a file.
The append is atomic and cannot be torn by a program failure or system crash.

The **pmemlog_appendv**() function appends to the log memory pool *plp* from
the scatter/gather list *iov* in a manner
similar to **writev**(2). The entire list of buffers is appended atomically,
as if the buffers in *iov* were concatenated in order.
The append is atomic and cannot be torn by a program failure or system crash.

# RETURN VALUE #

On success, **pmemlog_append**() and **pmemlog_appendv**() return 0.
On error, they return -1 and set *errno* appropriately.

# ERRORS #

**EINVAL** The vector count *iovcnt* is less than zero.

**ENOSPC** There is no room for the data in the log file.

**EROFS** The log file is open in read-only mode.

# NOTES #

Since **libpmemlog**(7) is designed as a low-latency code path,
many of the checks routinely done by the operating system for **writev**(2)
are not practical in the library's implementation of **pmemlog_appendv**().
No attempt is made to detect NULL or incorrect pointers, for example.
