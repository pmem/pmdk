# DESCRIPTION #

The _UW(pmemlog_ctl_get), _UW(pmemlog_ctl_set) and _UW(pmemlog_ctl_exec)
functions provide a uniform interface for querying and modifying the internal
behavior of **libpmemlog**(7) through the control (CTL) namespace.

See more in **pmem_ctl**(5) man page.


# CTL NAMESPACE #

prefault.at_create | rw | global | int | int | - | boolean

If set, every page of the pool will be touched and written to when the pool
is created, in order to trigger page allocation and minimize the performance
impact of pagefaults. Affects only the _UW(pmemlog_create) function.

Always returns 0.

prefault.at_open | rw | global | int | int | - | boolean

If set, every page of the pool will be touched and written to when the pool
is opened, in order to trigger page allocation and minimize the performance
impact of pagefaults. Affects only the _UW(pmemlog_open) function.

Always returns 0.

shutdown_state.enable | rw | global |int | int | - | boolean

Enable detection of ADR failure.

# CTL EXTERNAL CONFIGURATION #

In addition to direct function call, each write entry point can also be set
using two alternative methods.

The first method is to load a configuration directly from the **PMEMLOG_CONF**
environment variable.

The second method of loading an external configuration is to set the
**PMEMLOG_CONF_FILE** environment variable to point to a file that contains
a sequence of ctl queries.

See more in **pmem_ctl**(5) man page.
