# NAME #

**pmemlog_tell**(), **pmemlog_rewind**(),
**pmemlog_walk**() -- checks current write point for the log or walks through the log


# SYNOPSIS #

```c
#include <libpmemlog.h>

long long pmemlog_tell(PMEMlogpool *plp);
void pmemlog_rewind(PMEMlogpool *plp);
void pmemlog_walk(PMEMlogpool *plp, size_t chunksize,
	int (*process_chunk)(const void *buf, size_t len, void *arg),
	void *arg);
```

# DESCRIPTION #

The **pmemlog_tell**() function returns the current write point for the log,
expressed as a byte offset into the usable log space in the memory pool.
This offset starts off as zero on a newly-created log,
and is incremented by each successful append operation.
This function can be used to determine how much data is currently in the log.

The **pmemlog_rewind**() function resets the current write point for the log to zero.
After this call, the next append adds to the beginning of the log.

The **pmemlog_walk**() function walks through the log *plp*, from beginning to
end, calling the callback function *process_chunk* for each *chunksize* block
of data found. The argument *arg* is also passed to the callback to help
avoid the need for global state. The *chunksize* argument is useful for logs
with fixed-length records and may be specified as 0 to cause a single call
to the callback with the entire log contents passed as the *buf* argument. The
*len* argument tells the *process_chunk* function how much data *buf* is
holding. The callback function should return 1 if **pmemlog_walk**() should
continue walking through the log, or 0 to terminate the walk. The callback
function is called while holding **libpmemlog**(7) internal locks that make
calls atomic, so the callback function must not try to append to the log itself
or deadlock will occur.


# RETURN VALUE #

On success, **pmemlog_tell**() returns the current write point for the log.
On error, it returns -1 and sets *errno* appropriately.

The **pmemlog_rewind**() and **pmemlog_walk**() functions return no value.
