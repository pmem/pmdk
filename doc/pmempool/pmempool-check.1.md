# NAME #

**pmempool-check** - check and repair persistent memory pool

# SYNOPSIS #

```
$ pmempool check [<options>] <file>
```

# DESCRIPTION #

The **pmempool** invoked with *check* command checks consistency of a given pool file.
If the pool file is consistent **pmempool** exits with 0 value. If the
pool file is not consistent non-zero error code is returned.

In case of any errors, the proper message is printed. The verbosity level
may be increased using **-v** option. The output messages may be also suppressed using
**-q** option.

It is possible to try to fix encountered problems using **-r** option.
In order to be sure this will not corrupt your data you can either create backup of the
pool file using **-b** option or just print what would be fixed
without modifying original pool using **-N** option.

> NOTE:
Currently, checking the consistency of a *pmemobj* pool is **not** supported.

Create backup of a pool file before executing. Terminate if it is *not*
possible to create a backup file. This option requires **-r** option.

to repair a pool. This option requires `-r, --repair`.

`-q, --quiet`

Be quiet and don't print any messages.
