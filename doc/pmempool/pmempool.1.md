# NAME #

**pmempool** -- Persistent Memory Pool Management Tool


# SYNOPSIS #

```
$ pmempool [--help] [--version] <command> [<args>]
```

# DESCRIPTION #

The **pmempool** is a management tool for *Persistent Memory* pool files
created by **PMDK** libraries.

The main purpose of **pmempool** is to provide a user with a set of utilities
for off-line analysis and manipulation of pools created by pmem libraries.
The pmempool is a generic command which consists of subcommands for specific
purposes. Some of subcommands are required to work *without* any impact
on processed pool, but some of them *may* create a new or modify an existing one.

The **pmempool** may be useful for troubleshooting by system administrators

The latter may find these tools useful for testing and debugging purposes also.
