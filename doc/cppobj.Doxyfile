# Project related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This tag specifies the encoding used for all characters in the config file
# that follow. The default is UTF-8 which is also the encoding used for all text
# before the first occurrence of this tag. Doxygen uses libiconv (or the iconv
# built into libc) for the transcoding. See http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv
# for the list of possible encodings.
# The default value is: UTF-8.

DOXYFILE_ENCODING = UTF-8

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

PROJECT_NAME = "NVML C++ bindings"

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number. This
# could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or if some version
# control system is used.

PROJECT_NUMBER = "1.1.0"

# Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description
# for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewer a
# quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short.

PROJECT_BRIEF = "This is the C++ bindings documentation for NVML's libpmemobj."

# With the PROJECT_LOGO tag one can specify an logo or icon that is included in
# the documentation. The maximum height of the logo should not exceed 55 pixels
# and the maximum width should not exceed 200 pixels. Doxygen will copy the logo
# to the output directory.

PROJECT_LOGO =

# If the JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF tag is set to YES then doxygen will interpret the
# first line (until the first dot) of a Javadoc-style comment as the brief
# description. If set to NO, the Javadoc-style will behave just like regular Qt-
# style comments (thus requiring an explicit @brief command for a brief
# description.)
# The default value is: NO.

JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF = YES

# If the EXTRACT_PRIVATE tag is set to YES all private members of a class will
# be included in the documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_PRIVATE = YES

# If the HIDE_UNDOC_MEMBERS tag is set to YES, doxygen will hide all
# undocumented members inside documented classes or files. If set to NO these
# members will be included in the various overviews, but no documentation
# section is generated. This option has no effect if EXTRACT_ALL is enabled.
# The default value is: NO.

HIDE_UNDOC_MEMBERS = YES

# If the HIDE_UNDOC_CLASSES tag is set to YES, doxygen will hide all
# undocumented classes that are normally visible in the class hierarchy. If set
# to NO these classes will be included in the various overviews. This option has
# no effect if EXTRACT_ALL is enabled.
# The default value is: NO.

HIDE_UNDOC_CLASSES = YES

# The QUIET tag can be used to turn on/off the messages that are generated to
# standard output by doxygen. If QUIET is set to YES this implies that the
# messages are off.

QUIET = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the input files
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like myfile.cpp or
# directories like /usr/src/myproject. Separate the files or directories with
# spaces.
# Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.

INPUT = ../src/include/libpmemobj++
INPUT += ../src/include/libpmemobj++/README.md

# This tag can be used to specify the character encoding of the source files
# that doxygen parses. Internally doxygen uses the UTF-8 encoding. Doxygen uses
# libiconv (or the iconv built into libc) for the transcoding. See the libiconv
# documentation (see: http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv) for the list of
# possible encodings.
# The default value is: UTF-8.

INPUT_ENCODING = UTF-8

# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the
# FILE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard patterns (like *.cpp and
# *.h) to filter out the source-files in the directories. If left blank the
# following patterns are tested:*.c, *.cc, *.cxx, *.cpp, *.c++, *.java, *.ii,
# *.ixx, *.ipp, *.i++, *.inl, *.idl, *.ddl, *.odl, *.h, *.hh, *.hxx, *.hpp,
# *.h++, *.cs, *.d, *.php, *.php4, *.php5, *.phtml, *.inc, *.m, *.markdown,
# *.md, *.mm, *.dox, *.py, *.f90, *.f, *.for, *.tcl, *.vhd, *.vhdl, *.ucf,
# *.qsf, *.as and *.js.

FILE_PATTERNS = *.hpp

# The RECURSIVE tag can be used to specify whether or not subdirectories should
# be searched for input files as well.
# The default value is: NO.

RECURSIVE = YES

# The EXCLUDE tag can be used to specify files and/or directories that should be
# excluded from the INPUT source files. This way you can easily exclude a
# subdirectory from a directory tree whose root is specified with the INPUT tag.
#
# Note that relative paths are relative to the directory from which doxygen is
# run.

EXCLUDE =

# The EXAMPLE_PATH tag can be used to specify one or more files or directories
# that contain example code fragments that are included (see the \include
# command).

EXAMPLE_PATH = ../src/examples/libpmemobj/doc_snippets

# If the value of the EXAMPLE_PATH tag contains directories, you can use the
# EXAMPLE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard pattern (like *.cpp and
# *.h) to filter out the source-files in the directories. If left blank all
# files are included.

EXAMPLE_PATTERNS =

# If the EXAMPLE_RECURSIVE tag is set to YES then subdirectories will be
# searched for input files to be used with the \include or \dontinclude commands
# irrespective of the value of the RECURSIVE tag.
# The default value is: NO.

EXAMPLE_RECURSIVE = NO

# The IMAGE_PATH tag can be used to specify one or more files or directories
# that contain images that are to be included in the documentation (see the
# \image command).

IMAGE_PATH =

# The STRIP_FROM_PATH tag can be used to strip a user-defined part of the path.
# Stripping is only done if one of the specified strings matches the left-hand
# part of the path. The tag can be used to show relative paths in the file list.
# If left blank the directory from which doxygen is run is used as the path to strip.
# Note that you can specify absolute paths here, but also relative paths, which will
#  be relative from the directory where doxygen is started.
# This tag requires that the tag FULL_PATH_NAMES is set to YES.

STRIP_FROM_PATH = ../..

# The STRIP_FROM_INC_PATH tag can be used to strip a user-defined part of the
# path mentioned in the documentation of a class, which tells the reader which
# header file to include in order to use a class. If left blank only the name
# of the header file containing the class definition is used. Otherwise one
# should specify the list of include paths that are normally passed to the
# compiler using the -I flag.

STRIP_FROM_INC_PATH = ../src/include/

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the LATEX output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the GENERATE_LATEX tag is set to YES doxygen will generate LATEX output
# The default value is: YES.

GENERATE_LATEX = NO

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the HTML output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the GENERATE_HTML tag is set to YES doxygen will generate HTML output
# The default value is: YES.

GENERATE_HTML = YES

# The HTML_OUTPUT tag is used to specify where the HTML docs will be put. If a
# relative path is entered the value of OUTPUT_DIRECTORY will be put in front of
# it.
# The default directory is: html.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_OUTPUT = cpp_html

# The HTML_FILE_EXTENSION tag can be used to specify the file extension for each
# generated HTML page (for example: .htm, .php, .asp).
# The default value is: .html.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_FILE_EXTENSION = .html

# If the HTML_TIMESTAMP tag is set to YES then the footer of each generated HTML
# page will contain the date and time when the page was generated. Setting this
# to NO can help when comparing the output of multiple runs.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_TIMESTAMP = NO

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the preprocessor
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The PREDEFINED tag can be used to specify one or more macro names that are
# defined before the preprocessor is started (similar to the -D option of e.g.
# gcc). The argument of the tag is a list of macros of the form: name or
# name=definition (no spaces). If the definition and the "=" are omitted, "=1"
# is assumed. To prevent a macro definition from being undefined via #undef or
# recursively expanded use the := operator instead of the = operator.
# This tag requires that the tag ENABLE_PREPROCESSING is set to YES.

PREDEFINED = __cpp_lib_uncaught_exceptions _WIN32
