# NAME #

**pmem_memmove_persist**(), **pmem_memcpy_persist**(), **pmem_memset_persist**(),
**pmem_memmove_nodrain**(), **pmem_memcpy_nodrain**(), **pmem_memset_nodrain**()
-- functions that provide optimized copying to persistent memory


# SYNOPSIS #

```c
#include <libpmem.h>

void *pmem_memmove_persist(void *pmemdest, const void *src, size_t len);
void *pmem_memcpy_persist(void *pmemdest, const void *src, size_t len);
void *pmem_memset_persist(void *pmemdest, int c, size_t len);
void *pmem_memmove_nodrain(void *pmemdest, const void *src, size_t len);
void *pmem_memcpy_nodrain(void *pmemdest, const void *src, size_t len);
void *pmem_memset_nodrain(void *pmemdest, int c, size_t len);
```


# DESCRIPTION #

The **pmem_memmove_persist**(), **pmem_memcpy_persist**(), and
**pmem_memset_persist**(), functions provide the same memory copying
as their namesakes **memmove**(3), **memcpy**(3) and **memset**(3), and
ensure that the result has been flushed to persistence before returning.
For example, the following code is functionally equivalent to
**pmem_memmove_persist**():

```c
void *
pmem_memmove_persist(void *pmemdest, const void *src, size_t len)
{
	void *retval = memmove(pmemdest, src, len);

	pmem_persist(pmemdest, len);

	return retval;
}
```

Calling **pmem_memmove_persist**() may out-perform the above code,
however, since the **libpmem**(7) implementation may take advantage of the
fact that *pmemdest* is persistent memory and use instructions such as
*non-temporal* stores to avoid the need to flush processor caches.

>WARNING:
Using these functions where **pmem_is_pmem**(3) returns false
may not do anything useful. Use the normal libc functions in that case.


The **pmem_memmove_nodrain**(), **pmem_memcpy_nodrain**() and
**pmem_memset_nodrain**() functions are similar to
**pmem_memmove_persist**(), **pmem_memcpy_persist**(), and
**pmem_memset_persist**() described above, except they skip the final
**pmem_drain**() step. This allows applications to optimize cases where
several ranges are being copied to persistent memory, followed by a
single call to **pmem_drain**(). The following example illustrates how
these functions might be used to avoid multiple calls to
**pmem_drain**() when copying several ranges of memory to pmem:

```c
/* ... write several ranges to pmem ... */
pmem_memcpy_nodrain(pmemdest1, src1, len1);
pmem_memcpy_nodrain(pmemdest2, src2, len2);

/* ... */

/* wait for any pmem stores to drain from HW buffers */
pmem_drain();
```


# RETURN VALUE #

The **pmem_memmove_persist**(), **pmem_memcpy_persist**(), **pmem_memset_persist**(),
**pmem_memmove_nodrain**(), **pmem_memcpy_nodrain**() and **pmem_memset_nodrain**()
functions return the address of the destination.
