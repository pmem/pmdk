# NAME #

**rpmem_create**(), **rpmem_open**(),
**rpmem_set_attr**(), **rpmem_close**(), **rpmem_remove**()
-- most commonly used functions for remote access to *persistent memory*


# SYNOPSIS #

```c
#include <librpmem.h>

RPMEMpool *rpmem_create(const char *target, const char *pool_set_name,
	void *pool_addr, size_t pool_size, unsigned *nlanes,
	const struct rpmem_pool_attr *create_attr);
RPMEMpool *rpmem_open(const char *target, const char *pool_set_name,
	void *pool_addr, size_t pool_size, unsigned *nlanes,
	struct rpmem_pool_attr *open_attr);
int rpmem_set_attr(RPMEMpool *rpp, const struct rpmem_pool_attr *attr);
int rpmem_close(RPMEMpool *rpp);
int rpmem_remove(const char *target, const char *pool_set_name, int flags);
```


# DESCRIPTION #

The **rpmem_create**() function creates a remote pool on a given *target* node,
using pool *set* file *pool_set_name* to map the remote pool. *pool_set_name*
is a relative path in the root config directory on the *target* node.
*pool_addr* is a pointer to the associated local memory pool with size
*pool_size*. Both *pool_addr* and *pool_size* must be aligned to the system's
page size (see **sysconf**(3)). The size of the remote pool must be at least
*pool_size*. See **REMOTE POOL SIZE**, below, for details.
*nlanes* points to the maximum number of lanes which the caller is requesting.
Upon successful creation of the remote pool, \**nlanes* is set to the
maximum number of lanes supported by both the local and remote nodes.
See **LANES**, below, for details.
The *create_attr* structure contains the attributes used for creating the
remote pool. If *create_attr* is NULL, a zeroed structure with attributes will
be used to create the pool. The attributes are stored in pool's metadata and
can be read when opening the remote pool with **rpmem_open**().

The **rpmem_open**() function opens the existing remote pool with *set* file
*pool_set_name* on remote node *target*. *pool_set_name* is a relative path
in the root config directory on the *target* node. *pool_addr* is a pointer to
the associated local memory pool of size *pool_size*.
Both *pool_addr* and *pool_size* must be aligned to the system's page
size (see **sysconf**(3)). The size of the remote pool must be at least
*pool_size*. See **REMOTE POOL SIZE**, below, for details.
*nlanes* points to the maximum number of lanes which the caller is requesting.
Upon successful opening of the remote pool, \**nlanes* is set to the
maximum number of lanes supported by both the local and remote nodes.
See **LANES**, below, for details.

The **rpmem_set_attr**() function overwrites the pool's attributes.
The *attr* structure contains the attributes used for overwriting the remote
pool attributes that were passed to **rpmem_create**() at pool creation.
If *attr* is NULL, a zeroed structure with attributes will be used.
New attributes are stored in the pool's metadata.

The **rpmem_close**() function closes the remote pool *rpp*. All resources
are released on both the local and remote nodes. The remote pool itself
persists on the remote node and may be re-opened at a later time using
**rpmem_open**().

The **rpmem_remove**() function removes the remote pool with *set* file name
*pool_set_name* from node *target*. The *pool_set_name* is a relative path in
the root config directory on the *target* node. By default only the pool part
files are removed; the pool *set* file is left untouched. If the pool is not
consistent, the **rpmem_remove**() function fails.
The *flags* argument determines the behavior of **rpmem_remove**(). *flags* may
be either 0 or the bitwise OR of one or more of the following flags:

+ **RPMEM_REMOVE_FORCE** - Ignore errors when opening an inconsistent pool.
The pool *set* file must still be in appropriate format for the pool to be
removed.

+ **RPMEM_REMOVE_POOL_SET** - Remove the pool *set* file after removing the
pool described by this pool set.


# RETURN VALUE #

On success, **rpmem_create**() returns an opaque handle to the remote pool
for use in subsequent **librpmem** calls. If any error prevents
the remote pool from being created, **rpmem_create**() returns
NULL and sets *errno* appropriately.

On success, **rpmem_open**() returns an opaque handle to the remote
pool for in subsequent **librpmem** calls. If the *open_attr* argument
is not NULL, the remote pool attributes are returned in the provided structure.
If any error prevents the remote pool from being opened, **rpmem_open**()
returns NULL and sets *errno* appropriately.

On success, **rpmem_set_attr**() returns 0. On error, it returns -1 and sets
*errno* appropriately.

On success, **rpmem_close**() returns 0. On error, it returns a non-zero value
and sets *errno* appropriately.

On success, **rpmem_remove**() returns 0. On error, it returns a non-zero value
and sets *errno* appropriately.


# NOTES #

## REMOTE POOL SIZE ##
The size of a remote pool depends on the configuration in the pool *set* file
on the remote node. The remote pool size is the sum of the sizes of all part
files, decreased by 4096 bytes per part file. 4096 bytes of each part file are
utilized for storing internal metadata. **RPMEM_MIN_PART** and
**RPMEM_MIN_POOL** in **\<librpmem.h\>** define the minimum size allowed by
**librpmem** for a part file and a remote pool, respectively.

## LANES ##
The term *lane* means an isolated path of execution. The underlying hardware
utilized by both local and remote nodes may have limited resources that
restrict the maximum number of parallel **rpmem_persist**(3) operations.
The maximum number of supported lanes is returned by the **rpmem_open**() and
**rpmem_create**() function calls. The caller passes the maximum number of
lanes requested in \**nlanes*. If the pool is successfully created or opened,
\**nlanes* is updated to reflect the minimum of the number of lanes requested
by the caller and the maximum number of lanes supported by underlying hardware.
The application is obligated to use at most the returned number of
lanes in parallel.

**rpmem_persist**(3) does not provide any locking mechanism; thus any
serialization of calls must be performed by the application if required.

Each lane requires a separate connection, represented by a file descriptor.
If the system runs out of free file descriptors during **rpmem_create**() or
**rpmem_open**(), these functions will fail. See **nofile** in
**limits.conf**(5) for more details.
