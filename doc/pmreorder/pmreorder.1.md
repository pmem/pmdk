# NAME #

**pmreorder** - performs a persistent consistency check
		 using a store reordering mechanism

# SYNOPSIS #

```
$ python pmreorder <options>
```

# DESCRIPTION #

The pmreorder tool is a collection of python scripts designed
to parse and replay operations logged by pmemcheck -
a persistent memory checking tool.

Pmreorder performs the store reordering between persistent
memory barriers - a sequence of flush-fence operations.
It uses a consistency checking routine provided
in the command line options to check whether files are in a consistent state.
To help with this task, pmreorder sets an environmental variable
PMREORDER_MARKERS. Said variable contains a subset of markers
passed from the application, which is visible at the current state
of pmreordering. Individual markers are separated by vertical bar (‘|’).

Example of how PMREORDER_MARKERS variable can be parsed in c++ using regex
based environment variable tokener:

```cpp
	auto env = std::getenv("ENV_PASS");
	std::string senv(env ? env : "");
	std::regex rgx("(\\w+)(\\||$)");
	for (std::sregex_iterator it(senv.begin(), senv.end(), rgx), it_end;
	     it != it_end; ++it) {
		std::cout << (*it)[1].str() << std::endl;
	}
```

Considering that logging, replaying and reordering of operations
are very time consuming, it is recommended to use as few stores as
possible in test workloads.

# OPTIONS #

`-h, --help`

Prints synopsis and list of options.

`-l, --logfile <store_log>`

The pmemcheck log file to process.

`-c, --checker <prog|lib>`

Consistency checker type.

`-p, --path <path>`

Path to the consistency checker.
If the checker type is `prog` - given program **has to take a file name as
the last parameter** and the program has to return 0 for consistent cases
and 1 otherwise.
If the checker type is `lib` - `--name` parameter is required.

`-n, --name <name>`

The symbol name of the consistency checking function in the library.
The function **has to take a file name as the only parameter** and it
has to return 0 for consistent cases and 1 otherwise.
This parameter is required only if the checker type is `lib`.

`-o, --output <pmreorder_output>`

Set the logger output file.

`-e, --output-level <debug|info|warning|error|critical>`

Set the output log level.

`-r, --default-engine <NoReorderNoCheck |`
`NoReorderDoCheck |`
`ReorderFull |`
`ReorderPartial |`
`ReorderAccumulative |`
`ReorderReverseAccumulative>`

Set the initial reorder engine. Default value is `NoReorderNoCheck`.

`-x, --extended-macros <cli_macros|config_file>`

Assign an engine types to the defined marker.

`-v, --version`

Prints current version of pmreorder.

# ENGINES #

By default, the **NoReorderNoCheck** engine is used,
which means that for each set of stores, the tool
will pass-through all sequences of stores not reordered
and will not run consistency checker on them.

To enable different types of the reorder engine and
begin proper reordering tests, a number of other
engines exist:

+ **NoReorderDoCheck** - pass-through of unchanged operations.
Checks correctness of the stores as they were logged.
Useful for operations that do not require fail safety.

```
Example:
        input: (a, b, c)
        output: (a, b, c)
```

+ **ReorderAccumulative** - checks correctness on a growing
subset of the original sequence.

```
Example:
        input: (a, b, c)
        output:
               ()
               (a)
               (a, b)
               (a, b, c)
```

+ **ReorderReverseAccumulative** - checks correctness on a reverted growing
subset of the original sequence.

```
Example:
        input: (a, b, c)
        output:
               ()
               (c)
               (c, b)
               (c, b, a)
```

+ **ReorderPartial** - checks consistency on 3 randomly selected sequences
from a set of 1000 combinations of the original log, without repetitions.

```
 Example:
         input: (a, b, c)
         output:
                (b, c)
                (b)
                (a, b, c)
```

+ **ReorderFull** - for each set of stores generates and checks consistency
of all possible store permutations.
This might prove to be very computationally expensive for most workloads.
It can be useful for critical sections of code with limited number of stores.

```
 Example:
        input: (a, b, c)
        output:
               ()
               (a)
               (b)
               (c)
               (a, b)
               (a, c)
               (b, a)
               (b, c)
               (c, a)
               (c, b)
               (a, b, c)
               (a, c, b)
               (b, a, c)
               (b, c, a)
               (c, a, b)
               (c, b, a)
```

When the engine is passed with an `-r` option, it will be used
for each logged set of stores.
Additionally, the `-x` parameter can be used to switch engines
separately for any marked code sections.
For more details about `-x` extended macros functionality see section
INSTRUMENTATION below.

# INSTRUMENTATION #

The core of **pmreorder** is based on user-provided named markers.
Sections of code can be 'marked' depending on their importance,
and the degree of reordering can be customized by the use of various
provided engines.

For this purpose, Valgrind's pmemcheck tool exposes a
generic marker macro:

+ **VALGRIND_PMC_EMIT_LOG(value)**

It emits log to *store_log* during pmemcheck processing.
*value* is a user-defined marker name.
For more details about pmemcheck execution see
PMEMCHECK STORE LOG section below.

Example:
```
main.c
.
.
.
VALGRIND_PMC_EMIT_LOG("PMREORDER_MEMSET_PERSIST.BEGIN");

pmem_memset_persist(...);

VALGRIND_PMC_EMIT_LOG("PMREORDER_MEMSET_PERSIST.END");
.
.
.
```

There are a few rules for macros creation:

+ Valid macro can have any name,
but begin and end section have to match -
they are case sensitive.
+ Macro must have `.BEGIN` or `.END` suffix.
+ Macros can't be crossed.

Defined markers can be assigned engines types and configured
through the **pmreorder** tool using the `-x` parameter.

There are two ways to set macro options:

+ Using command line interface in format:
```
PMREORDER_MARKER_NAME1=Marker1,PMREORDER_MARKER_NAME2=Marker2
```

+ Using configuration file in .json format:
```
{
    "PMREORDER_MARKER_NAME1":"Marker1",
    "PMREORDER_MARKER_NAME2":"Marker2"
}
```

For more details about available
engines types, see ENGINES section above.

**libpmemobj**(7), **libpmem**(7) and **libpmem2**(7) also provide set of macros
that allow to change reordering engine on library or function level:

`<library_name|api_function_name>`

Example of configuration on function level:
```
{
    "pmemobj_open":"NoReorderNoCheck",
    "pmemobj_memcpy_persist":"ReorderPartial"
}
```

Example of configuration on library level
(affecting all library functions):
```
{
    "libpmemobj":"NoReorderNoCheck"
}
```

# PMEMCHECK STORE LOG #

To generate *store_log* for **pmreorder** run pmemcheck
with additional parameters:

```
valgrind \
	--tool=pmemcheck \
	-q \
	--log-stores=yes \
	--print-summary=no \
	--log-file=store_log.log \
	--log-stores-stacktraces=yes \
	--log-stores-stacktraces-depth=2 \
	--expect-fence-after-clflush=yes \
	test_binary writer_parameter
```

For further details of pmemcheck parameters see
[pmemcheck documentation](https://pmem.io/valgrind/generated/pmc-manual.html)

# ENVIRONMENT #

By default all logging from PMDK libraries is disabled.
To enable API macros logging set environment variable:

+ **PMREORDER_EMIT_LOG**=1

User defined markers passed from an application
are stored in the variable:

+ **PMREORDER_MARKERS**

# EXAMPLE #

```
python pmreorder.py \
		-l store_log.log \
		-r NoReorderDoCheck \
		-o pmreorder_out.log \
		-c prog \
		-x PMREORDER_MARKER_NAME=ReorderPartial \
		-p checker_binary checker_parameter(s)
```

Checker binary will be used to run consistency checks on
"store_log.log", output of pmemcheck tool. Any inconsistent
stores found during **pmreorder** analysis will be logged
to `pmreorder_out.log`.
