# NAME #

_UW(vmem_create), **vmem_create_in_region**(), **vmem_delete**(),
**vmem_check**(), **vmem_stats_print**() -- volatile memory pool management


# SYNOPSIS #

```c
#include <libvmem.h>

_UWFUNCR1(VMEM, *vmem_create, *dir, size_t size)
VMEM *vmem_create_in_region(void *addr, size_t size);
void vmem_delete(VMEM *vmp);
int vmem_check(VMEM *vmp);
void vmem_stats_print(VMEM *vmp, const char *opts);
```

# DESCRIPTION #

To use **libvmem**, a *memory pool* is first created. This is most commonly
done with the _UW(vmem_create) function described below. The other
**libvmem** functions are for less common cases, where applications have
special needs for creating pools or examining library state.

The _UW(vmem_create) function creates a memory pool and returns an opaque
memory pool handle of type *VMEM\**. The handle is then used with **libvmem**
functions such as **vmem_malloc**() and **vmem_free**() to provide the
familiar *malloc*-like programming model for the memory pool.

The pool is created by allocating a temporary file in the directory *dir*,
in a fashion similar to **tmpfile**(3), so that the file name does not appear
when the directory is listed, and the space is automatically freed when the
program terminates. *size* bytes are allocated and the resulting space is
memory-mapped. The minimum *size* value allowed by the library is defined in
**\<libvmem.h\>** as **VMEM_MIN_POOL**. The maximum allowed size is not
limited by **libvmem**, but by the file system on which *dir* resides.
The *size* passed in is the raw size of the memory pool. **libvmem** will
use some of that space for its own metadata, so the usable space will be less.

_UW(vmem_create) can also be called with the **dir** argument pointing to a
device DAX. In that case the entire device will serve as a volatile pool.
Device DAX is the device-centric analogue of Filesystem DAX. It allows memory
ranges to be allocated and mapped without need of an intervening file system.
For more information please see **ndctl-create-namespace**(1).

**vmem_create_in_region**() is an alternate **libvmem** entry point
for creating a memory pool. It is for the rare case where an application
needs to create a memory pool from an already memory-mapped region. Instead of
allocating space from a file system, **vmem_create_in_region**()
is given the memory region explicitly via the *addr* and *size* arguments.
Any data in the region is lost by calling **vmem_create_in_region**(),
which will immediately store its own data structures for managing the pool
there. As with _UW(vmem_create), the minimum *size* allowed is defined
as **VMEM_MIN_POOL**. The *addr* argument must be page aligned. Undefined
behavior occurs if *addr* does not point to a contiguous memory region in
the virtual address space of the calling process, or if the *size* is larger
than the actual size of the memory region pointed to by *addr*.

The **vmem_delete**() function releases the memory pool *vmp*.
If the memory pool was created using _UW(vmem_create), deleting it
allows the space to be reclaimed.

The **vmem_check**() function performs an extensive consistency
check of all **libvmem** internal data structures in memory pool *vmp*.
Since an error return indicates memory pool corruption, applications
should not continue to use a pool in this state. Additional details about
errors found are logged when the log level is at least 1 (see **DEBUGGING AND
ERROR HANDLING** in **libvmem**(7)). During the consistency check
performed by **vmem_check**(), other operations on the same memory pool are
locked out. The checks are all read-only; **vmem_check**() never modifies the
memory pool. This function is mostly useful for **libvmem** developers during
testing/debugging.

The **vmem_stats_print**() function produces messages containing statistics
about the given memory pool. Output is sent to *stderr* unless the user
sets the environment variable **VMEM_LOG_FILE**, or the application supplies a
replacement *print_func* (see **MANAGING LIBRARY BEHAVIOR** in **libvmem**(7)).
The *opts* string can either be NULL or it can contain a list of options that
change the statistics printed. General information that never changes
during execution can be omitted by specifying "g" as a character within the
opts string. The characters "m" and "a" can be specified to omit merged arena
and per arena statistics, respectively; "b" and "l" can be specified to omit
per size class statistics for bins and large objects, respectively.
Unrecognized characters are silently ignored. Note that thread caching may
prevent some statistics from being completely up to date. See **jemalloc**(3)
for more detail (the description of the available *opts* above was taken from
that man page).


# RETURN VALUE #

On success, _UW(vmem_create) returns an opaque memory pool handle of type
*VMEM\**. On error, it returns NULL and sets *errno* appropriately.

On success, **vmem_create_in_region**() returns an opaque memory pool handle
of type *VMEM\**. On error, it returns NULL and sets *errno* appropriately.

The **vmem_delete**() function returns no value.

The **vmem_check**() function returns 1 if the memory pool is found to be
consistent, and 0 if the check was performed but the memory pool is not
consistent. If the check could not be performed, **vmem_check**() returns -1.

The **vmem_stats_print**() function returns no value.
