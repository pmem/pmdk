# NAME #

**libpmem2** - persistent memory support library (EXPERIMENTAL)

# SYNOPSIS #

```c
#include <libpmem2.h>
cc ... -lpmem2
```

# DESCRIPTION #

# GRANULARITY #

XXX: explain the concept of the granularity

# CAVEATS #

# ENVIRONMENT #

# DEBUGGING #

Two versions of **libpmem2** are typically available on a development
system. The normal version, accessed when a program is linked using the
**-lpmem2** option, is optimized for performance. That version skips checks
that impact performance and never logs any trace information or performs any
run-time assertions.

A second version of **libpmem2**, accessed when a program uses the libraries
under _DEBUGLIBPATH(), contains run-time assertions and trace points. The
typical way to access the debug version is to set the environment variable
**LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH** to _LDLIBPATH(). Debugging output is
controlled using the following environment variables. These variables have
no effect on the non-debug version of the library.

+ **PMEM2\_LOG\_LEVEL**

The value of **PMEM2_LOG_LEVEL** enables trace points in the debug version
of the library, as follows:

+ **0** - This is the default level when **PMEM2\_LOG\_LEVEL** is not set.
No log messages are emitted at this level.

+ **1** - Additional details on any errors detected are logged, in addition
to returning the *errno*-based errors as usual. The same information
may be retrieved using _UW(pmem2_errormsg).

+ **2** - A trace of basic operations is logged.

+ **3** - Enables a very verbose amount of function call tracing in the
library.

+ **4** - Enables voluminous and fairly obscure tracing
information that is likely only useful to the **libpmem2** developers.

Unless **PMEM2\_LOG\_FILE** is set, debugging output is written to *stderr*.

+ **PMEM2\_LOG\_FILE**

Specifies the name of a file where
all logging information should be written. If the last character in the name
is "-", the *PID* of the current process will be appended to the file name when
the log file is created. If **PMEM2\_LOG\_FILE** is not set, output is
written to *stderr*.
