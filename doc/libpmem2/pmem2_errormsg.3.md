# NAME #

_UW(pmem2_errormsg) - returns last error message

# SYNOPSIS #

```c
#include <libpmem2.h>

_UWFUNC(pmem2_errormsg, void)
```

_UNICODE()

# DESCRIPTION #

If an error is detected during the call to a **libpmem2**(7) function, the
application may retrieve an error message describing the reason of the failure
from _UW(pmem2_errormsg). The error message buffer is thread-local;
errors encountered in one thread do not affect its value in
other threads. The buffer is never cleared by any library function; its
content is significant only when the return value of the immediately preceding
call to a **libpmem2**(7) function indicated an error.
The application must not modify or free the error message string.
Subsequent calls to other library functions may modify the previous message.

# RETURN VALUE #

The _UW(pmem2_errormsg) function returns a pointer to a static buffer
containing the last error message logged for the current thread. If *errno*
was set, the error message may include a description of the corresponding
error code as returned by **strerror**(3).

# SEE ALSO #

**strerror**(3), **libpmem2**(7) and **<http://pmem.io>**
