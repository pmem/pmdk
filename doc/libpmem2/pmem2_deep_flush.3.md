# NAME #

**pmem2_deep_flush**() - highly reliable persistent memory synchronization

# SYNOPSIS #

```c
#include <libpmem2.h>

int pmem2_deep_flush(struct pmem2_map *map, void *ptr, size_t size)
```

# DESCRIPTION #

The **pmem2_deep_flush**() function forces any changes in the range \[*ptr*, *ptr*+*len*)
from the *map* to be stored durably in the most reliable persistence domain
available to software. In particular, on supported platforms, this enables
the code not to rely on automatic cache or WPQ (write pending queue) flush on power failure (ADR/eADR).

Since this operation is usually much more expensive than regular persist, it
should be used sparingly. Typically, the application should only ever use this
function as a precaution against hardware failures, e.g., in code that detects
silent data corruption caused by unsafe shutdown (see more in **libpmem2_unsafe_shutdown**(7)).

Applications should generally not assume the support for this functionality
in the platform, and not treat **PMEM2_E_NOSUPP** as a fatal error.

# RETURN VALUE #

The **pmem2_deep_flush**() returns 0 on success or one of the following
error values on failure:

* **PMEM2_E_DEEP_FLUSH_RANGE** - the provided flush range is not a
subset of the map's address space.

* **PMEM2_E_DAX_REGION_NOT_FOUND** - the underlying device region id cannot be
detected.

* **PMEM2_E_NOSUPP** - the platform has no facilities for deep flush.

* -**errno** set by failing **write**(2), while trying to use the Device Dax
*deep_flush* interface.

* -**errno** set by failing **open**(2), while trying to open the Device Dax
*deep_flush* interface.

* -**errno** set by failing **msync**(2), while trying to perform a deep
flush on a regular DAX volume.
