# NAME #

pmemcto_stats_print -- write human-readable memory pool statistics


# SYNOPSIS #

```c
#include <libpmemcto.h>

void pmemcto_stats_print(PMEMctopool *pcp, const char *opts);

```


# DESCRIPTION #

The **pmemcto_stats_print**() function produces messages containing statistics
about the given memory pool.  The output is printed using **libpmemcto**(7)
internal *print_func* function (see **pmemcto_set_funcs**(3)).  That means
the output typically appears on *stderr* unless the caller supplies
a replacement *print_func* or sets the environment variable
**PMEMCTO_LOG_FILE** to direct output elsewhere.  The *opts* string can either
be NULL or it can contain a list of options that change the stats printed.
General information that never changes during execution can be omitted
by specifying "g" as a character within the opts string.  The characters
"m" and "a" can be specified to omit merged arena and per arena statistics,
respectively; "b" and "l" can be specified to omit per size class statistics
for bins and large objects, respectively.  Unrecognized characters are silently
ignored.  Note that thread caching may prevent some statistics from being
completely up to date.
See **jemalloc**(3) for more detail (the description of the available *opts*
above was taken from that man page).
