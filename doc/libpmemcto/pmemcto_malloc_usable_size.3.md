# NAME #

pmemcto_malloc_usable_size -- obtain size of block of memory allocated from pool


# SYNOPSIS #

```c
#include <libpmemcto.h>

size_t pmemcto_malloc_usable_size(PMEMctopool *pcp, void *ptr);
```


# DESCRIPTION #


The **pmemcto_malloc_usable_size**() function provides the same semantics
as **malloc_usable_size**(3), but operates on the memory pool *pcp* instead
of the process heap supplied by the system.  It returns the number of usable
bytes in the block of allocated memory pointed to by *ptr*, a pointer to
a block of memory allocated by **pmemcto_malloc**(3) or a related function.


# RETURN VALUE #

The **pmemcto_malloc_usable_size**() function returns the number of usable
bytes in the block of allocated memory pointed to by *ptr*.
If *ptr* is NULL, 0 is returned.


# SEE ALSO #

**malloc**(3), **malloc_usable_size**(3), **pmemcto_malloc**(3),
**jemalloc**(3), **libpmemcto**(7) and **<http://pmem.io>**
