# NAME #

pmemcto_aligned_alloc -- allocate aligned memory


# SYNOPSIS #

```c
#include <libpmemcto.h>

void *pmemcto_aligned_alloc(PMEMctopool *pcp, size_t alignment, size_t size);
```


# DESCRIPTION #

The **pmemcto_aligned_alloc**() function provides the same semantics
as **aligned_alloc**(3), but operates on the memory pool *pcp* instead
of the process heap supplied by the system.  It allocates *size* bytes from
the memory pool and returns a pointer to the allocated memory.
The memory is not zeroed.
The memory address will be a multiple of *alignment*, which must be a power
of two.


# RETURN VALUE #

On success, **pmemcto_aligned_alloc**() function returns a pointer to the
allocated memory.
If *size* is 0, then **pmemcto_aligned_alloc**() returns either NULL,
or a unique pointer value that can later be successfully passed
to **pmemcto_free**(3).  If **pmemcto_aligned_alloc**() is unable to satisfy
the allocation request, a NULL pointer is returned and *errno* is set
appropriately.


# ERRORS #

**EINVAL** *alignment* was not a power of two.

**ENOMEM** Insufficient memory available to satisfy allocation request.
