# NAME #

**pmemset_config_set_acceptable_states**() - set acceptable part states in shutdown
data state structure

# SYNOPSIS #

```c
#include <libpmemset.h>

struct pmemset_config;
int pmemset_config_set_acceptable_states(struct pmemset_config *cfg, uint64_t states);

```

# DESCRIPTION #

The **pmemset_config_set_acceptable_states**() function sets acceptable part states
in config *cfg* structure, *states* variable is a bitmask of part states.

Provided *states* bitmask is compared with the determined part state during the mapping
of a new part using **pmemset_map**(3) function. If determined part state is not among
provided states then **pmemset_map**(3) function terminates and returns an error.

This feature depends on the SDS feature, for more information please see **pmemset_source_set_sds**(3)
and **libpmemset_shutdown_state**(7).

The mapping process determines the part to be in one of the following states:

* **PMEMSET_PART_STATE_INDETERMINATE** - the part state cannot be determined because of
the errors during retrieval of device information.

* **PMEMSET_PART_STATE_OK** - the part is internally consistent and was closed cleanly.
Application can assume that no custom recovery is needed.

* **PMEMSET_PART_STATE_OK_BUT_ALREADY_OPEN** - the part is internally consistent, but
it is in use by the libpmemset library. It is an expected state when creating multiple
mappings from the same source.

* **PMEMSET_PART_STATE_OK_BUT_INTERRUPTED** - the part is internally consistent, but it
was not closed cleanly.

* **PMEMSET_PART_STATE_CORRUPTED** - the part can contain invalid data as a result of hardware
failure. Reading the part is unsafe. Application might need to perform consistency checking and
custom recovery on user data.

**PMEMSET_PART_STATE_OK** and **PMEMSET_PART_STATE_OK_BUT_ALREADY_OPEN** are the default
acceptable states for each new config structure.

# RETURN VALUE

The **pmemset_config_set_acceptable_states**() function returns 0 on success or a negative
error code on failure.

# ERRORS #

**pmemset_config_set_acceptable_states**() can fail with the following errors:

* **PMEMSET_E_INVALID_PART_STATES** - combination of part states to be set in SDS structure
contains a part state undefined by **libpmemset**(7) library
