Fri Jul 2 2021 Piotr Balcer <piotr.balcer@intel.com>

	* Version 1.11.0

	This release:
	 - Adds new APIs for libpmem2, most notably there are new functions
	to shrink and extend an existing reservation and a new iterator API
	for mappings contained within an existing reservation. There's also
	a new function to retrieve a numa node for a source.
	- Makes the pmemobj_open() and pmemobj_close() functions from libpmemobj
	thread-safe. It's now easier to correctly manage persistent memory
	pools in a parallel environment.
	- Introduces a new API in libpmemobj to globally change the method of
	assigning arenas to threads. The default is to rely on a OS per-thread
	key to store arena information. This release introduces an option
	to avoid the use of thread-local keys by simply using one global
	arena for all threads in a pool.

	Other changes and notable bug fixes:
	 - pmem2: don't force smaller alignment for fsdax mappings
	 - rpmem: various fixes for powerpc64le
	 - doc: fix documentation of pmem_is_pmem()
	 - common: fix various minor problems found by static analysis
	 - pmem2: arm64: fix possible data loss on ARMv8.2+ (improper flushing)

	This release introduces no changes to the on-media layout and is
	fully compatible with the previous version of PMDK.

Wed Oct 28 2020 Piotr Balcer <piotr.balcer@intel.com>

	* Version 1.10

	This release introduces a new stable PMDK library, libpmem2, which
	is the next major release of libpmem.
	This library has an entirely new, but familiar, API that addresses many
	shortcomings of the previous version, while retaining all of its
	functionality. To learn more, see https://pmem.io/pmdk/libpmem2/ or
	libpmem2(7).
	The old library, libpmem, is still going to be maintained for the
	foreseeable future, but we'd like to encourage any new applications to
	leverage libpmem2.

Wed Oct 28 2020 Piotr Balcer <piotr.balcer@intel.com>

	* Version 1.9.2

	This release reverts an incorrect change in SDS handling
	"pool: disable SDS check if not supported", and introduces
	a proper fix for the issues that patch attempted to correct.

	- Switches the default instruction set for memcpy, memmove and memset
	implementations on x86 to AVX512, and introduces numerous performance
	improvements for those operations on AVX and SSE2 fallback paths.
	- Optimizes transactional allocations in libpmemobj by avoiding one
	extraneous cache miss and reducing the amount of work required to perform
	a reservation.
	- Introduces a new API in libpmemobj, pmemobj_tx_set_failure_behavior,
	that enables the application to control the behavior of aborting
	transactions.

	physical page allocation during file allocation.
	- Stabilizes support for ppc64.

	Other changes:
	- pmem: mem[cpy|set] optimization when eADR is available
	- obj: detect msync failures in non-pmem variants of mem[cpy|move|set]

	Notable bug fixes:
	- core: fix Last_errormsg_get when NO_LIBPTHREAD is defined

Mon Sep 30 2019 Marcin Ślusarz <marcin.slusarz@intel.com>

	* Version 1.7

	This release:
	- Introduces new APIs in libpmemobj for managing space used by transactions.
	  (see pmemobj_tx_log_append_buffer man page for details)
	- Introduces new APIs in librpmem, splitting rpmem_persist into rpmem_flush
	  and rpmem_drain, allowing applications to use the flush + drain model
	  already known from libpmem. (libpmemobj does not use this feature yet)
	- Optimizes large libpmemobj transactions by significantly reducing
	  the amount of memory modified at the commit phase.
	- Optimizes tracking of libpmemobj reservations.
	- Adds new flags for libpmemobj's pmemobj_tx_xadd_range[_direct] API:
	  POBJ_XADD_NO_SNAPSHOT and POBJ_XADD_ASSUME_INITIALIZED, allowing
	  applications to optimize how memory is tracked by the library.

	To support some of the above changes the libpmemobj on-media layout had
	to be changed, which means that old pools have to be converted using
	pmdk-convert >= 1.7.

	Other changes:
	- obj: fix merging of ranges when NOFLUSH flag is used (pmem/issues#1100)
	- rpmem: fix closing of ssh connection (pmem/issues#995, pmem/issues#1060)
	- obj: abort transaction on pmemobj_tx_publish failure

	Internal changes:
	- test: fault injection tests for pmemblk, pmemlog, and pmemobj
	- test: improved Python testing framework
	- test: support real pmem in bad blocks tests
	- common: allow not building examples and benchmarks

	* Version 1.2.4
	Bug fixes:
	- common: fix device dax detection (compatibility with newer kernels)

Tue Mar 26 2019 Marcin Ślusarz <marcin.slusarz@intel.com>

	* Version 1.6

	This release:
	- Enables unsafe shutdown and bad block detection on Linux
	  on systems with libndctl >= 63. It is expected that systems with
	  libndctl >= 63 has necessary kernel support (Linux >= 4.20).
	  However, due to bugs in libndctl = 63 and Linux = 4.20, it is
	  recommended to use libndctl >= 64.1 and Linux >= 5.0.4.
	  On systems with libndctl < 63, PMDK uses old superuser-only
	  interfaces. Support for old or new interfaces is chosen at BUILD
	  time.
	- Introduces arena control interface in pmemobj, allowing applications
	  to tweak performance and scalability of heap operations. See
	  pmemobj_ctl_get man page ("heap" namespace) for details.
	- Introduces copy_on_write mode, which allows testing applications
	  using pmemobj with pmreorder. See pmemobj_ctl_get man page
	  ("copy_on_write" namespace) for details.

	Other changes:
	- allocate file space when creating a pool on existing file
	  (pmem/issues#167)
	- initial support for testing using fault injection
	- initial Python test framework
	- improve performance of pmemobj_pool_by_ptr

	Bug fixes:
	- common: work around tmpfs bug during pool creation
	  (pmem/issues#1018)
	- pool: race-free pmempool create --max-size
	- obj: don't modify remote pools in pmemobj_check

Tue Feb 19 2019 Marcin Ślusarz <marcin.slusarz@intel.com>

	This release has had two major focus areas - performance and RAS
	(Reliability, Availability and Serviceability). Beyond that, it introduces
	new APIs, new tools and many other improvements. As a side effect
	of performance optimizations, the libpmemobj on-media layout had to be
	changed, which means that old pools have to be converted using pmdk-convert.
	libpmemcto experiment has been finished and removed from the tree.

	For more details, please see https://pmem.io/2018/10/22/release-1-5.html.

	New features:
	- common: unsafe shutdown detection (SDS)
	- common: detection and repair of uncorrectable memory errors (bad blocks)
	- pool: new "feature" subcommand for enabling and disabling detection of
	  unsafe shutdown and uncorrectable memory errors
	- common: auto flush detection on Windows (on Linux since 1.4)
	- pmreorder: new tool for verification of persistent memory algorithms
	- obj: new on media layout
	- pmem/obj: new flexible memcpy|memmove|memset API
	- obj: new flushing APIs: pmemobj_xpersist, pmemobj_xflush
	  (PMEMOBJ_F_RELAXED)
	- rpmem: new flag RPMEM_PERSIST_RELAXED for rpmem_persist
	- obj: lazily initialized volatile variables (pmemobj_volatile)
	  (EXPERIMENTAL)
	- obj: allocation classes with alignment
	- obj: new action APIs: pmemobj_defer_free, POBJ_XRESERVE_NEW,
	  POBJ_XRESERVE_ALLOC
	- blk/log: new "ctl" API

	Optimizations:

	- obj: remove actions limit
	- common: new dependency on libndctl on Linux
	- pmempool: "convert" subcommand is now a wrapper around pmdk-convert
	  (please see https://github.com/pmem/pmdk-convert)
	- obj: C++ bindings have been moved to a new repository
	  (please see https://github.com/pmem/libpmemobj-cpp)

	Bug fixes:
	- obj: fix type numbers for pmemobj_list_insert_new
	- pmem: fix inconsistency in pmem_is_pmem

Fri Jun 29 2018 Marcin Ślusarz <marcin.slusarz@intel.com>

	* Version 1.4.1

	In 1.4 development cycle, we created new daxio utility
	(command line tool for performing I/O on Device-DAX), but due
	to some complications we had to disable it just before
	the 1.4 release.

Thu Jul 13 2017 Krzysztof Czurylo <krzysztof.czurylo@intel.com>

	* Version 1.3
	This release introduces some useful features and optimizations

	the new pmemobj_ctl APIs.  For details, please check the feature
	requests identified by the issue numbers listed next to the items below.

	Other important changes are related to performance tuning and
	stabilization of librpmem library, which is used by libpmemobj to get
	remote access to persistent memory and to provide basic data replication
	over RDMA.  The librpmem is still considered experimental.

Tue Feb 21 2017 Krzysztof Czurylo <krzysztof.czurylo@intel.com>

	* Version 1.2.1
	This NVML release changes the behavior of pmem_is_pmem() on Linux.
	The pmem_is_pmem() function will now return true only if the entire
	range is mapped directly from Device DAX (/dev/daxX.Y) without an
	intervening file system, and only if the corresponding file mapping
	was created with pmem_map_file().  See libpmem(7) for details.

Fri Dec 30 2016 Krzysztof Czurylo <krzysztof.czurylo@intel.com>

	* Version 1.2 - Windows Technical Preview #1
	This is the first Technical Preview release of NVML for Windows.
	It is based on NVML 1.2 version, but not all the 1.2 features
	are ported to Windows. In particular, Device DAX and remote access
	to persistent memory (librpmem) are not supported by design.

	NOTE: This release has not gone through the full validation cycle,
	but only through some basic tests on Travis and AppVeyor.
	Thus, it cannot be assumed "Production quality" and should not
	be used in production environments.

	Besides several minor improvements and bug fixes, all the other
	changes since NVML 1.2 release were related to Windows support:
	- win: port libvmem (and jemalloc)
	- win: benchmarks Windows port
	- win: fix mapping files of unaligned length
	- win: clean up possible race condition in mmap_init()
	- win: enable QueryVirtualMemoryInformation() in pmem_is_pmem()
	- test: check open handles at START/DONE
	- test: port all the remaining unit tests
	  (scope, pmem_map, obj_debug, util_poolset, pmempool_*)
	- win: add resource files for versioning

	Known issues and limitations of Windows version of NVML:
	- Unicode support is missing.  The UTF/USC-encoded file paths
	  or pool set files may not be handled correctly.
	- The libvmmalloc library is not ported yet.
	- The on-media format of pmem pools is not portable at the moment.
	  The pmem pools created using Windows version of NVM libraries
	  cannot be open on Linux and vice versa.
	- Despite the fact the current version of NVML would work
	  with any recent version of Windows OS, to take full
	  advantage of PMEM and NVML features and to benefit from
	  the PMEM performance, the recommended platforms needs be
	  equipped with the real NVDIMMs hardware and should support
	  the native, Microsoft's implementation of DAX-enabled file
	  system (i.e. Windows Server 2016 or later).
	  In case of using NVML with older versions of Windows or with
	  the custom implementation of PMEM/DAX drivers, the performance
	  might not be satisfactory.  Please, contact the provider
	  of PMEM/DAX drivers for your platform to get the customized
	  version of NVML in such case.

Thu Dec 15 2016 Krzysztof Czurylo <krzysztof.czurylo@intel.com>

	* Version 1.2
	This NVML release causes a "flag day" for libpmemobj.
	The pmemobj pools built under NVML 1.1 are incompatible with pools built
	under NVML 1.2 and later.  This is because an issue was discovered with
	the alignment of locks (pmem/issues#358) and, although rare, the issue potentially
	impacts program correctness, making the fix mandatory.
	The major version number of the pmemobj pool layout and the version
	of the libpmemobj API is changed to prevent the use of the potentially
	incorrect layout.

	Other key changes introduced in this release:
	- Add Device DAX support, providing that "optimized flush" mechanism
	  defined in SNIA NVM Programming Model can safely be used, even
	  if PMEM-aware file system supporting that model is not available,
	  or if the user does not want to use the file system for some reason.
	- Add a package for libpmemobj C++ bindings.
	  C++ API is no longer considered experimental.
	  Web-based documentation for C++ API is available on https://pmem.io.
	- Add "sync" and "transform" commands to pmempool utility.
	  The "sync" command allows one to recover missing or corrupted part(s)
	  of a pool set from a healthy replica, while the "transform" command
	  is a convenient way for modifying the structure of an existing
	  pool set, i.e. by adding or removing replicas.
	- Add experimental support for remote access to persistent memory and
	  basic remote data replication over RDMA (librpmem).  Experimental
	  support for remote replicas is also provided by libpmemobj library.

	New features:
	- common: add Device DAX support (pmem/issues#197)
	- obj: add C++ bindings package (libpmemobj++-devel)
	- obj: add TOID_OFFSETOF macro
	- pmempool: add "sync" and "transform" commands
	  (pmem/issues#172, pmem/issues#196)

	Bug fixes:
	- obj: force alignment of pmem lock structures (pmem/issues#358)
	- blk: cast translation entry to uint64_t when calculating data offset
	- obj: fix Valgrind instrumentation of chunk headers and cancelled
	  allocations
	- obj: set error message when user called pmemobj_tx_abort()
	- obj: fix status returned by pmemobj_list_insert() (pmem/issues#226)
	- obj: defer allocation of global structures

	Optimizations:
	- obj: fast path for pmemobj_pool_by_ptr() when inside a transaction
	- obj: simplify and optimize allocation class generation

	Experimental features:
	- rpmem: add support for remote access to persistent memory and basic
	  remote data replication over RDMA
	- libpmempool: add pmempool_sync() and pmempool_transform() (pmem/issues#196)
	- obj: introduce pmemobj_oid()
	- obj: add pmemobj_tx_xalloc()/pmemobj_tx_xadd_range() APIs and
	  the corresponding macros
	- obj: add transaction stage transition callbacks

Thu Jun 23 2016 Krzysztof Czurylo <krzysztof.czurylo@intel.com>

	* Version 1.1
	This NVML release introduces a new version of libpmemobj pool layout.
	Internal undo log structure has been modified to improve performance
	of pmemobj transactions.  Memory pools created with older versions
	of the libpmemobj library must be converted to the new format using
	"pmempool convert" command.  See pmempool-convert(1) for details.

	A new "libpmempool" library is available, providing support for
	off-line pool management and diagnostics.  Initially it provides only
	"check" and "repair" operations for log and blk memory pools, and for
	BTT devices.

	Other changes:
	- pmem: deprecate PCOMMIT
	- blk: match BTT Flog initialization with Linux NVDIMM BTT
	- pmem: defer pmem_is_pmem() initialization (pmem/issues#158)
	- obj: add TOID_TYPEOF macro

	Bug fixes:
	- doc: update description of valid file size units (pmem/issues#133)
	- pmempool: fix --version short option in man page (pmem/issues#135)
	- pmempool: print usage when running rm without arg (pmem/issues#136)
	- cpp: clarify polymorphism in persistent_ptr (pmem/issues#150)
	- obj: let the before flag be any non-zero value (pmem/issues#151)
	- obj: fix compare array pptr to nullptr (pmem/issues#152)
	- obj: cpp pool.get_root() fix (pmem/issues#156)
	- log/blk: set errno if replica section is specified (pmem/issues#161)
	- cpp: change exception message	(pmem/issues#163)
	- doc: remove duplicated words in man page (pmem/issues#164)
	- common: always append EXTRA_CFLAGS after our CFLAGS

	Experimental features:
	- Implementation of C++ bindings for libpmempobj is complete.
	  Web-based documentation for C++ API is available on https://pmem.io.
	  Note that C++ API is still considered experimental.  Do not use it
	  in production environments.
	- Porting NVML to Windows is in progress.  There are MS Visual Studio
	  solution/projects available, allowing to compile libpmem, libpmemlog,
	  libpmemblk and libpmemobj on Windows, but the libraries are not fully
	  functional and most of the test are not enabled yet.

Thu Apr 07 2016 Krzysztof Czurylo <krzysztof.czurylo@intel.com>

	* Version 1.0
	The API of six libraries (libpmem, libpmemblk, libpmemlog,
	libpmemobj, libvmem, libvmmalloc) is complete and stable.
	The on-media layout of persistent memory pools will be maintained
	from this point, and if changed it will be backward compatible.
	Man pages are all complete.
	This release has been validated to "Production quality".

	For the purpose of new features planned for next releases of NVML
	there have been some API modifications made:
		- pmem: pmem_map replaced with pmem_map_file
		- log/blk: 'off_t' substituted with 'long long'
		- obj: type numbers extended to 64-bit
		- obj: new entry points and macros added:
		  pmemobj_tx_errno, pmemobj_tx_lock, pmemobj_mutex_timedlock,
		  TX_ADD_DIRECT, TX_ADD_FIELD_DIRECT, TX_SET_DIRECT

	Other key changes since version 0.4 include:
		- common: updated/fixed installation scripts
		- common: eliminated dependency on libuuid
		- pmem: CPU features/ISA detection using CPUID
		- obj: improved error handling
		- obj: atomic allocation fails if constructor returns error
		- obj: multiple performance optimizations
		- obj: object store refactoring
		- obj: additional examples and benchmarks

	This release also introduces a prototype implementation
	of C++ bindings for libpmemobj.  Note that C++ API is still
	experimental and should not be used in production environments.

Fri Dec 04 2015 Krzysztof Czurylo <krzysztof.czurylo@intel.com>

	* Version 0.4
	This NVML version primarily focuses on improving code quality
	and reliability.  In addition to a couple of bug fixes,
	the changes include:
		- benchmarks for libpmemobj, libpmemblk and libvmem
		- additional pmemobj tests and examples
		- pool mapping address randomization
		- added pmempool "rm" command
		- eliminated libpmem dependency on libpthread
		- enabled extra warnings
		- minor performance improvements
	Man pages are all complete.
	This release is considered "Beta quality" by the team, having
	been thoroughly validated, including significant performance analysis.
	The pmempool command does not yet support "check" and "repair"
	operations for pmemobj type pools.

Sun Sep 13 2015 Andy Rudoff <andy.rudoff@intel.com>

	* Version 0.3
	NVML is now feature complete, adding support for:
		- pool sets
		- pmemobj local replication (active/passive)
		- experimental valgrind support
		- pmempool support for all pool types
	Man pages are all complete.
	This release is considered "Alpha quality" by the team, having
	gone through significant validation but only some performance
	analysis at this point.

Tue Jun 30 2015 Andy Rudoff <andy.rudoff@intel.com>

	* Version 0.2
	NVML now consists of six libraries:
		- libpmem                            (basic flushing, etc)
		- libpmemblk, libpmemlog, libpmemobj (transactions)
		- libvmem, libvmmalloc               (volatile use of pmem)
	The "pmempool" command is available for managing pmem files.
	Man pages for all the above are complete.
	The only things documented in man pages but not implemented are:
		- pmem sets (ability to spread a pool over a set of files)
		- replication (coming for libpmemobj)
	The pmempool command does not yet support pmemobj type pools.

Thu Sep 11 2014 Andy Rudoff <andy.rudoff@intel.com>

	* Version 0.1
	Initial development done in 0.1 builds
