This is src/test/tools/bttcreate/README.

This directory contains a tool for creating BTT pool in given file.
It's used as a helper program by some unit tests.

Usage:
	$ bttcreate [-s <pool_file_size>] [-b <block_size>]
		[-l <max_lanes>] [-u <uuid>] [-t] [-v] <pool_name>

	Valid arguments:
	-s <size>        - size of the pool file (i.e. size of the pool + 4KB)
	-b <size>        - block size
	-l <decimal>     - maximum number of lanes
	-u <uuid>        - parent uuid (generated by default)
	-t               - do not allocate blocks
	-v               - verbose

Example:
	./bttcreate file_name -s 20M -b 1K -l 256
		-u "9047cad6-53e1-4ba8-bcdd-a9fb411f7392" -v
