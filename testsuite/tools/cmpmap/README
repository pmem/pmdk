Persistent Memory Development Kit

This is src/test/tools/cmpmap/README.

This directory contains a tool for comparing files byte by byte using mmap.
It lets you compare regular files as well as DAX devices.

Currently only checking if part of a file is zeroed is implemented.

It's used as a helper program by some unit tests.

Usage:
	$ cmpmap [options] file1 [file2]

Available options:
	-l, --length=N	- compare up to N bytes,
	-o, --offset=N	- skip N bytes at start of the files,
	-z, --zero	- compare bytes to NUL,
	-h, --help	- print help message.
