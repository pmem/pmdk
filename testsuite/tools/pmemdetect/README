Persistent Memory Development Kit

This is src/test/tools/pmemdetect/README.

This directory contains a simple application for PMEM-aware filesystem
and device dax detection. By default, If the 'path' argument points to a
directory on a PMEM device, the program exits with a status code indicating
success. If '-d' options is specified, the application checks if specified
path points to a device dax. Otherwise, the status code indicates failure.

It's used as a helper program by some unit tests.

Usage:
	$ pmemdetect [-d] <path>

Available options:
 -d     -- check if given path points to a device dax
