#### The libvmmalloc library

**libvmmalloc** interposes the traditional _malloc_/_free_ interfaces and,
in a way fully transparent to the program, substitutes the system heap
with a volatile memory pool built on memory-mapped file.  Such memory pool
works in a similar manner as the memory pools provided by **libvmem**,
except that it is created and destroyed automatically for each process
that uses **libvmmalloc**.

The typical usage of **libvmmalloc** is to load it before all other libraries
by setting the environment variable **LD_PRELOAD**.

Man pages that contains a list of the interfaces provided:

* Man page for [libvmmalloc current master](../manpages/master/libvmmalloc.3.html)
* Latest releases:
   * [libvmmalloc version 1.1](../manpages/v1.1/libvmmalloc.3.html)
   * [libvmmalloc version 1.0](../manpages/v1.0/libvmmalloc.3.html)
